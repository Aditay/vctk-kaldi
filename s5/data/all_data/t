p225_001 Please call Stella
p225_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p225_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p225_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p225_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p225_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p225_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p225_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p225_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p225_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p225_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p225_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p225_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p225_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p225_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p225_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p225_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p225_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p225_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p225_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p225_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p225_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p225_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p225_025 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p225_026 How are you, sir ?
p225_027 So is that it, then ?
p225_028 Do I have a favourite ?
p225_029 What do we do ?
p225_030 People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background
p225_033 It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much
p225_035 A hostile bid is prevented for another nine months
p225_036 It was a close call
p225_037 In fact, they are the future of investment
p225_038 Diving is no part of football
p225_039 However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials
p225_040 You'd better believe it
p225_044 It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council
p225_045 People were determined to change the Government in the last election
p225_046 No details of the talks were given
p225_049 I have learned from him
p225_051 We are committed to the ban
p225_052 Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room
p225_053 I have made that offer
p225_054 Four other charges were dropped
p225_056 Clearly, it can go either way
p225_057 However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result
p225_058 However, the problem is the timing
p225_059 But retail banking would be run from Halifax
p225_060 Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses
p225_061 Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world
p225_062 I was very pleased with them today, though
p225_063 Both sides have been hit by injury
p225_064 It could take some time
p225_065 There is no pressure on us
p225_066 It is a job creation scheme
p225_067 Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help
p225_070 That is bound to happen
p225_071 He is in the queue
p225_072 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p225_073 So, did she meet him ?
p225_081 I had no intention of misleading anyone
p225_082 That view is held by many others within the industry
p225_083 Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll
p225_084 He is delighted, and he has every right to be
p225_086 In fact, he should never have been in the field
p225_089 Officers recovered a second body in the area
p225_090 I did not have a bet on myself
p225_092 There is a contract in existence for Allan
p225_094 That's as it should be
p225_103 Everyone deserves to share in this success
p225_104 His is a success story by any standard
p225_108 Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants
p225_109 That might help a bit
p225_110 Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor
p225_111 It isn't a happy memory
p225_113 The big issue for us is the review
p225_114 I told him I was a long time ago
p225_115 Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots
p225_116 Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits
p225_117 We have no influence on the Government's policy on the euro
p225_118 We suffered a lot for seven years
p225_120 The industry is not well organised
p225_121 You get a lot for your money
p225_122 I didn't feel under any pressure
p225_123 It is the latter which has prompted the warning
p225_124 As for the warning, it was not needed
p225_126 The squad is too small
p225_127 It is a common problem
p225_128 Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg
p225_131 Another High Street retailer was not so lucky
p225_133 I think he's the favourite
p225_135 We have seen a copy of the report
p225_136 But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government
p225_141 Drugs are used a lot at the fishing
p225_142 Well, you can have a tree
p225_143 Russell did not appeal the committee's decision
p225_144 She will do for me
p225_145 Why change it ?
p225_147 Does the name matter ?
p225_149 Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme
p225_150 But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company
p225_151 Nothing has been put into action
p225_152 The weather forecast isn't good
p225_153 We have a clean bill of health
p225_156 I would like to see the figures for the second quarter
p225_157 He was asked to quit
p225_158 Inside, the atmosphere was quiet
p225_159 Neither side can win this war
p225_165 The Internet is no substitute for customer service
p225_166 Like last month, it is simply too early to make a call
p225_169 Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry
p225_171 The report was criticised by the Scottish Consumer Council
p225_172 Nobody did in those days
p225_173 But the story of the play is worth a play in itself
p225_174 He was a big influence on our decision to make this show
p225_175 At that point, the structure of the board was changed
p225_176 Treatment is not an issue with these people
p225_177 The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton
p225_179 They know no other way
p225_182 We are just glad to be alive
p225_191 People will ask about us
p225_192 However, this idea is never developed
p225_193 It's very difficult to find a buyer
p225_195 It is hard to tell
p225_196 I think, therefore I am ?
p225_197 Who was she ?
p225_199 And they were being paid ?
p225_200 It looked like a river
p225_201 The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts
p225_202 The occasion was the New Labour conference in Brighton last year
p225_203 They have the cash and the fire power
p225_208 You are a great player
p225_210 Scotland will play its part
p225_211 He added that he was very sad about O Neill
p225_212 After that nothing could save him
p225_218 We used to live with dignity in our country
p225_219 They did not attack the themes of the book
p225_220 He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland
p225_221 It's all change at Kilmarnock
p225_222 In each case they were a goal down
p225_223 The police have an awful lot to explain
p225_224 He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda
p225_225 It is good for our team
p225_235 I always felt that I was in control of the match
p225_236 That will be the criteria for the future
p225_237 Frankly, we were lucky to get second
p225_238 Paterson can afford to be generous
p225_239 In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game
p225_240 We are in the hat
p225_241 Well, they were the unlucky ones
p225_242 The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days
p225_243 The irony was not lost
p225_244 What was the matter for concern ?
p225_248 Does that put pressure on us ?
p225_253 Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars
p225_254 The problem was a social problem
p225_257 My son was too young to die
p225_258 We were not allowed to go to help them
p225_264 That should be the subject matter of a public debate
p225_265 It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland
p225_266 No other vehicle was involved in the crash
p225_268 I realised I was lucky to have it
p225_273 He has not created a Festival resource
p225_274 We have not reached the point of no return
p225_275 Similar measures are expected in England and Wales
p225_276 He will make an excellent chief inspector
p225_277 It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence
p225_279 Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise
p225_280 Sadly, the revival could not be sustained
p225_281 They were not at the property yesterday
p225_282 It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow
p225_285 We have to break that cycle
p225_286 I wanted to change the formula
p225_287 She said the charity would continue to monitor the case
p225_289 Motherwell have no such good fortune
p225_290 Scotch beef is badly missed
p225_291 We would hope to make progress on that next year
p225_293 It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players
p225_294 However, we had no failures in our side
p225_295 Clydesdale Bank declined to comment
p225_296 It goes back a long way
p225_297 Innocent people have a right to live in safety
p225_298 It was deployed in the Gulf War
p225_299 They had to learn to work from the consumer back
p225_300 I can hardly believe it
p225_301 I must do something about it
p225_302 Three hours later, the man was free
p225_303 And it had been a marvellous occasion
p225_305 Cast Away now on general release
p225_308 I thought his speech was a disgrace
p225_309 Are they free ?
p225_310 What are they for ?
p225_312 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p225_314 We believe the world has too many refugees already
p225_315 The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand
p225_316 It is beyond the government to deal with this tragedy
p225_317 At the moment, it is very difficult to know
p225_318 The problem was he thought you were a big man
p225_319 There's still a bit to go
p225_320 We have a good healthy debate
p225_322 Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources
p225_323 It is a court case
p225_324 There is no plan B
p225_325 The court was shown a video of the house on that day
p225_326 He will go a long way
p225_328 It is just a tax on employment
p225_329 There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh
p225_330 We are a peaceful people
p225_331 Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure
p225_332 It's difficult to predict the future
p225_334 Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed
p225_335 We are in the end game
p225_336 I came into this world with nothing
p225_337 But they have the sound
p225_346 It wasn't a flight of fancy
p225_347 Boy is the town a mess
p225_348 Does it matter ?
p225_349 How do you take them away ?
p225_350 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p225_351 After the match, do you ?
p225_352 He was then replaced by Ross
p225_353 THE pain was almost too much to bear
p225_354 This action reflects a slump in bookings
p225_355 Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal
p225_356 I said he was set to retire
p225_357 It is a sign of hope
p225_358 The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk
p225_359 But we welcome this document
p225_363 There is The Beautiful Game to write
p225_365 You did not see it
p225_366 It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet
p226_001 Please call Stella
p226_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p226_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p226_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p226_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p226_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p226_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p226_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p226_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p226_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p226_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p226_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p226_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p226_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p226_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p226_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p226_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p226_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p226_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p226_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p226_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p226_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p226_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p226_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p226_025 He has not been named
p226_026 That's no bad thing
p226_027 They should have a major rethink about the event for next year
p226_028 Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed
p226_029 We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent
p226_030 Because we do not need it
p226_031 This is the window
p226_032 I was an athlete
p226_033 From that day on we started to look for another full back
p226_034 Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist
p226_036 It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise
p226_037 It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies
p226_039 It has failed
p226_040 It was clear
p226_041 It is not for any other purpose
p226_042 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p226_043 Is there a new way forward?
p226_044 Mexico City was a wonderful experience
p226_045 This represents a tough game for us
p226_046 Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison
p226_047 We need to chat
p226_048 It's a blessing
p226_049 But it might have done
p226_050 Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland
p226_051 It has been a horrible, horrible time
p226_052 It is the whole package
p226_053 He had no enemies
p226_054 I got a great response from the players, as I had expected
p226_055 However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress
p226_056 For the meantime, though, the signs are good
p226_057 It's the big omission
p226_058 Next league matches Celtic
p226_059 She's a spy!
p226_060 It is unique
p226_061 It is not a process which can be completed overnight
p226_062 This is a scheme that has a lot of potential
p226_063 It's a real challenge
p226_064 It is not great art
p226_065 You do not change overnight
p226_066 Art is extra
p226_067 It's a matter of balance
p226_068 Scotland had great assets
p226_069 I've spent a lot of time on buses
p226_070 There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music
p226_071 I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset
p226_072 Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise
p226_073 The script was funny
p226_074 You need a trademark
p226_075 Painful, but only because it's true
p226_076 Help is needed
p226_077 Tommy is not a problem
p226_078 There could be a way back
p226_079 Neither it is
p226_080 The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow
p226_082 It is a terrible place
p226_083 It works for us
p226_084 I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February
p226_085 It can be halted
p226_086 This is the way things should be handled
p226_088 Detection is often difficult
p226_089 He seems to be pleased with the picture
p226_090 New Zealand rugby is totally different
p226_091 Someone who cares
p226_092 It's just awful
p226_093 It's never too late
p226_094 Every time I play I do not understand their reaction
p226_095 That will come after the game on Saturday
p226_096 However, it did not end that way
p226_097 We could not get any possession
p226_098 If you could find it
p226_099 He is hungry for success and I am the same
p226_100 They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs
p226_101 It was mayhem
p226_102 I am not willing to say anything about any couple
p226_103 They were outside the circle
p226_104 However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full
p226_105 May not have been at fault?
p226_106 It was some time before she found out he was safe
p226_107 It was a good performance
p226_108 That time is not now, however
p226_109 Oil embargo endorsed
p226_110 Before the game we went for a pint
p226_111 It was an adventure
p226_112 The eye was badly closed on Sunday
p226_113 The Prime Minister was very saddened to hear about this
p226_114 It was really enjoyable on Saturday
p226_115 I did not think about the Ryder Cup
p226_116 It is normal
p226_117 I don't have many friends
p226_118 We have to look at everything before we make any final decision
p226_119 Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee
p226_120 It would not do any harm to reinforce the message
p226_121 Maybe this battle has been
p226_122 Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants
p226_124 This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election
p226_125 She's got to say something
p226_126 It is a delight on every level
p226_127 We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors
p226_128 I felt very strongly that England should have it
p226_129 She has been shot
p226_130 I thought it was a fantastic game
p226_131 I was furious
p226_132 Child abuse is a dreadful thing
p226_133 She really suffered for her art
p226_134 It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation
p226_135 I do not think this family will ever get over this
p226_136 Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't
p226_137 It will be too hot
p226_138 The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk
p226_139 I am now unemployed
p226_140 They made such decisions in London
p226_141 Our intentions are real
p226_142 Government will intervene
p226_143 Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general
p226_144 Police could not say if the two incidents were connected
p226_145 On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door
p226_146 It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions
p226_148 Three penalties were given
p226_149 In this case, the farmer had actually given permission
p226_150 We just had a go
p226_151 We have seen a copy of the report
p226_152 That could mean the difference between life and death in action
p226_153 That group reported just before Christmas
p226_154 Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power
p226_155 It's an issue that will have to be tackled
p226_156 The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday
p226_157 Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday
p226_158 We will turn the corner
p226_159 The weather affected the other two games in Fife
p226_160 They should stop the bombing
p226_161 These days are long gone
p226_162 It is an attitude of mind
p226_163 I've learned from my mistakes
p226_164 They say that vital evidence was not heard in court
p226_165 We have to move forward
p226_166 However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands
p226_167 They will do their own thing
p226_168 It is too much for me
p226_169 Nobody did in those days
p226_171 A helpline number is published at the end of this article
p226_172 It became a book by itself
p226_173 His team management was protective
p226_174 It's quite a routine
p226_175 It is not either national standards or local control
p226_176 If that's the case, he will struggle
p226_177 I took the gun
p226_178 Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked
p226_179 No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death
p226_180 I have the first six months of next season to prove myself
p226_181 I've been there
p226_183 I have no sympathy with her at all
p226_184 It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait
p226_185 It is not fair
p226_186 It just came into my head that day
p226_187 I had a train to catch
p226_188 Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval
p226_189 The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment
p226_190 Suddenly, the rugby world had changed
p226_191 Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender
p226_192 People will ask about us
p226_193 The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date
p226_194 It is a case of taking a risk
p226_195 It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work
p226_197 There was no option
p226_198 Is that it?
p226_199 We live by the rule of law
p226_200 Is that success?
p226_201 The service from the other players was super
p226_202 They are in the euro
p226_203 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p226_204 The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office
p226_205 I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling
p226_206 Some realism was needed about time, resources and management
p226_207 It's a mixture of everything
p226_208 I don't want to use it
p226_209 Now, it's all right
p226_210 It's like a garage
p226_211 But I am a worried man
p226_212 They like being on the front pages of the newspapers
p226_213 Feel the heat?
p226_214 I'm pleased about one thing
p226_215 I am delighted for Simon
p226_216 His third goal was superb
p226_217 It's not ideal
p226_218 I was so nervous
p226_219 I might come back
p226_220 For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon
p226_221 Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement
p226_223 But we have not heard a thing from Diego
p226_224 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p226_225 A career as a doctor is on hold
p226_226 At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher
p226_227 Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval
p226_228 I am immensely sad
p226_229 I'd never seen a play about me
p226_230 The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia
p226_231 The track is currently covered in snow
p226_232 My wife and family are the support system
p226_233 Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable
p226_234 Stewart will travel with some confidence
p226_235 Police later said the scheme would end in November
p226_236 It is set in Paris
p226_237 It is not an option, but a policy requirement
p226_238 Hospitals are for the ill
p226_239 It would still have been a good film, but very different
p226_240 She is well balanced
p226_241 They are all bright and different
p226_242 It's only fair
p226_243 We lost our composure towards the interval, he said
p226_244 It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet
p226_245 I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday
p226_246 His body was never found
p226_247 We did not compete with any other local farmer
p226_248 I was shocked
p226_249 I should think so, too
p226_251 There's the mix
p226_252 There will be widespread support on all sides
p226_253 I was never going to play against Scotland
p226_254 At the end of the day, one has to be careful
p226_255 That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective
p226_256 Blair is very positive at European Councils
p226_257 Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites
p226_258 That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match
p226_259 Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom
p226_260 It is a mark of respect from the inmates
p226_261 He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention
p226_262 Today we can say that a new era has begun
p226_263 I would have the hammer in the crowd
p226_264 This court has made an order which has not been observed
p226_265 The work between the musicians and the fire is very important
p226_266 The warning is timely
p226_267 George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks
p226_268 That decision is for the British Parliament and people
p226_269 They are never here
p226_270 We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter
p226_271 He was popular
p226_272 Frankly, we should all have such problems
p226_273 It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players
p226_274 She has every confidence in his performance of his duties
p226_276 It's a way of life
p226_278 I feel pretty good
p226_279 In essence, the teaching profession has a choice
p226_280 He has a wealth of experience
p226_281 It happens from time to time
p226_283 He looked very sharp
p226_284 Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident
p226_285 It was a virus
p226_286 Yet, it worked
p226_287 Who will perform?
p226_288 The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together
p226_289 This is a national crisis
p226_290 Scotland were beaten again
p226_291 It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence
p226_292 It goes back a long way
p226_293 He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained
p226_294 The results are sometimes contentious
p226_295 He should have won
p226_296 If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world
p226_297 There's a pause
p226_298 The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland
p226_299 There was no hint of scandal
p226_300 I thought it was my only chance
p226_301 However, the snow was welcomed by some
p226_302 Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman
p226_303 One was a lawyer
p226_304 Our task is to complete the picture
p226_305 A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election
p226_306 We believe the world has too many refugees already
p226_307 The whole matter is somewhat in the air
p226_308 This is a war over our home
p226_309 In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge
p226_310 It is no country for a man or woman of letters
p226_311 I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions
p226_312 It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing
p226_313 The minister is the engineer
p226_314 I did not name it
p226_315 It was a question of patience
p226_316 The whole region is in shock
p226_317 It's about my time as a guitarist
p226_318 Kids are terrible
p226_319 Craig is a major concern for us
p226_320 The home team had an amazing start
p226_321 My body is clearly capable
p226_322 Referees are easy targets
p226_323 He said she was mad
p226_324 We are in the end game
p226_325 I am very happy to be here
p226_326 The airport was even different
p226_327 We do the same
p226_328 That's the law of the land
p226_329 But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament
p226_330 The weekly average was three hours
p226_331 Donald was his friend
p226_332 I am so upset
p226_333 It was no secret that I wanted to sign him
p226_334 On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research
p226_335 The boat was fantastic
p226_336 It is a time bomb
p226_337 I'd like to take the plunge
p226_338 Later in the day he was forced to explain his position
p226_339 My view has now completely changed
p226_340 You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel
p226_341 In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times
p226_342 Three years ago he would have been
p226_343 I'm so pleased the show has won a prize
p226_344 He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French
p226_345 They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance
p226_346 But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party
p226_347 It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition
p226_348 Look at the witnesses
p226_349 He's been the key to everything
p226_350 That is the very reason why it was so vital
p226_351 This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required
p226_352 His contract was then not renewed
p226_353 A report is the first step in a criminal case in India
p226_354 That is a break with tradition
p226_355 A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company
p226_356 She is free
p226_357 I kept going for her
p226_358 You must have a government and a good civil service
p226_359 He's very explosive
p226_360 No other job in world football can compare to this one
p226_361 Our numbers are small
p226_362 Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported
p226_363 Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment
p226_364 This is a club on the rise
p226_365 I have got a wife to feed
p226_366 It's not pretty, but it's effective
p226_367 Equity declined to comment
p226_368 All the investment is possible through the public sector
p226_369 He took over our lives
p226_370 Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world
p227_001 Please call Stella
p227_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p227_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p227_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p227_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p227_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p227_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p227_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p227_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p227_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p227_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p227_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p227_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p227_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p227_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p227_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p227_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection in the sun's rays by the rain
p227_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p227_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p227_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p227_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p227_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p227_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p227_025 Meetings will also remain private
p227_026 Movement has to take place
p227_027 I feel I did not have enough time
p227_028 We will look into it
p227_029 This is a central issue
p227_030 Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy
p227_031 The Premier League has been a huge success
p227_032 There, you were just a body
p227_033 It is not for any other purpose
p227_034 President Bush is at war
p227_035 I became a widow overnight
p227_036 Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man
p227_037 This represents a tough game for us
p227_038 She hopes to study in Britain one day
p227_039 Among them are many criminals
p227_040 Yesterday, he was busy in his office
p227_041 He looks like an Afghan
p227_042 It will concentrate on the Thames Valley
p227_043 I'd come back from London
p227_044 If I was a woman
p227_045 He was a home referee
p227_046 There was no safety net
p227_047 The casting of her husband was an accident
p227_048 We have to look beyond the very short term
p227_049 I expect a rapid response
p227_050 That is very hard, alone
p227_051 The motive for the shooting was not known
p227_052 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p227_053 Four other charges were dropped
p227_054 I could not do it
p227_055 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p227_056 How are you, sir ?
p227_057 So is that it, then ?
p227_058 Do I have a favourite ?
p227_059 What do we do ?
p227_060 The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow
p227_061 There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement
p227_062 They have to come up with a solution
p227_063 We will pay their bills
p227_064 Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued
p227_065 He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture
p227_066 Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses
p227_067 I have proved that in the past
p227_068 He had been a singer
p227_069 They would now be able to look forward with confidence
p227_070 Then followed a bout of flu
p227_071 Both sides have been hit by injury
p227_072 Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator
p227_073 It is a terrible place
p227_074 Even the one she loved
p227_075 After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction
p227_076 There may be reasons for it
p227_077 I first met him last summer
p227_078 Last week, he was taken into hospital
p227_079 Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games
p227_080 Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat
p227_081 By then, he was walking on water
p227_082 We have to offer value for money
p227_083 They lived for their children
p227_084 Potions said he would drive
p227_085 The latter is due to be finished in February
p227_086 This is a complex and detailed report
p227_087 The outsourcing deal will take effect in September
p227_088 We will deal with the refugees
p227_089 You might not make it
p227_090 It is open season on the Old Firm
p227_091 That is the important thing
p227_092 For once, you should believe the hype
p227_093 Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons
p227_094 Their attitude is all wrong
p227_095 You are like an animal
p227_096 No, the equipment is extra
p227_097 The following are the principal provisions
p227_098 It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials
p227_099 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p227_100 I had a fortunate war
p227_101 I did not see any reason to change the captain
p227_102 Saddam Hussein is a devil
p227_103 It was never a starter
p227_104 And the match was not too bad, either
p227_105 Such actions are rarely popular
p227_106 It is safe in our hands
p227_107 Then came the farewell to Europe
p227_108 It is much as it has been described
p227_109 You can spend money on housing
p227_110 That admission is not surprising
p227_111 Not a great deal has changed in the last decade
p227_112 It has removed a bit of guilt
p227_113 However, we have to be cautious
p227_114 But we could only help a handful of people
p227_116 It is just a tax on employment
p227_117 This should begin in October
p227_118 My life has changed a lot
p227_119 We did what we had to do
p227_120 Why do it otherwise ?
p227_121 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p227_122 So, did she meet him ?
p227_123 So what is the campaign about ?
p227_124 And does it ?
p227_125 You've got to be vigilant
p227_126 We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak
p227_127 Any success would have been an improvement
p227_128 On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door
p227_129 And I have some advice for my old friend
p227_130 He is a great addition to our team
p227_131 However, this move is dependent upon the sale of the existing site
p227_132 I felt he was excellent
p227_133 They could use a boost
p227_134 It is a vicious circle
p227_135 We could easily have lost that game
p227_136 This is a limited market
p227_137 Our position is quite simple
p227_138 Five minutes later, the home team were back in front
p227_139 Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes
p227_140 Drugs are used a lot at the fishing
p227_141 He's not a Celtic man
p227_142 It opens the door to the Champions League
p227_143 So I got a blood test
p227_144 It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment
p227_145 These men are a part of India
p227_146 Like the others, he was arrested
p227_147 There's only one team in Ayrshire
p227_148 It was deployed in the Gulf War
p227_149 That was the difference between the sides
p227_150 Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment
p227_151 I was shaking on the blocks
p227_152 She had gone to the Catholic school
p227_153 This year, this month, will be special for Torrance
p227_154 The strong pound also took its toll
p227_155 It was a funny feeling
p227_156 I'd love to be like Peter
p227_157 Adams is surely worth a chance
p227_158 It is difficult to say
p227_159 He was in great spirits
p227_160 Seven people were later detained by police
p227_161 They want to see him
p227_162 Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo
p227_163 Nobody did in those days
p227_164 There is no signature on this document
p227_165 We've made a couple of albums
p227_166 What happened in that game ?
p227_167 Are you going to win ?
p227_168 Was it the wife ?
p227_169 Why change it ?
p227_170 What do we want to do that for ?
p227_171 The people are the hero
p227_172 One season, they might do well
p227_173 They made such decisions in London
p227_174 The second aspect was the fear of failure
p227_175 The jury is still out
p227_176 But he has a lifeline
p227_177 The expansions will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank
p227_178 I'm just going to hit the shot
p227_179 It makes no influence on the public
p227_180 That will apply to both sets of fans
p227_181 I think it's a good sign
p227_183 I have spoken to head office
p227_184 Well, you can have a tree
p227_186 They bought the property four years ago
p227_187 He is believed to live in Britain
p227_188 We've just had it confirmed
p227_189 A copy of the report will be sent to them
p227_190 This is the time to use it
p227_191 You know the sort of thing
p227_192 They were seriously after him
p227_193 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p227_194 Trading conditions have not been that bad
p227_195 I'm interested in interesting work
p227_196 It will be reviewed in The Herald tomorrow
p227_197 The force is with them
p227_198 If the director is with you
p227_199 He made no order on costs
p227_200 I guess I was lucky, though
p227_201 This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds
p227_203 It was served by sheriff officers
p227_204 This will be our new beginning
p227_205 They have the cash and the fire power
p227_206 My heart is with the artist
p227_207 That might mean another delay
p227_208 However, it is not as simple as this
p227_209 The sanctions are about collective punishment
p227_210 This is a holy place
p227_211 Does the name matter ?
p227_212 how do you get it back ?
p227_213 What are you not good at ?
p227_214 I think, therefore I am ?
p227_215 Who was she ?
p227_216 You have caught a serial killer
p227_217 It seemed a moving and fitting tribute
p227_218 The move follows a review of the Singapore
p227_219 They make a selective perception process
p227_220 There is no quick fix
p227_222 They have known the hard times
p227_223 That might help a bit
p227_226 I'm just a regular person
p227_227 My daughter is an adult
p227_228 He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland
p227_229 It's just a normal life
p227_230 He must get to know himself
p227_231 And the World Cup has not even begun
p227_232 He remains a main board director of Royal
p227_233 The fight is under way
p227_235 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p227_236 They all made the European Ryder Cup team
p227_237 We can certainly build on this
p227_238 William Hague delighted his party
p227_239 There is a world of difference
p227_240 We played them off the pitch
p227_241 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p227_242 I can't wait to meet him
p227_243 My wife and family are the support system
p227_244 They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house
p227_245 It is the voice of the survivors
p227_246 She died in middle age
p227_247 It is set in Paris
p227_248 You will have seen the adverts
p227_249 It is possible to be too good
p227_250 Moreover, it must be for all sports
p227_251 They were in the wrong place at the wrong time
p227_252 The irony was not lost
p227_253 Three weeks later, he resigned
p227_254 It is a court case
p227_255 It might be sad, but it's a fact
p227_256 She took them for a term
p227_257 Kingfisher can afford to wait
p227_258 Nato was not a love affair
p227_259 We lost our composure towards the interval, he said
p227_260 Hospitals and school building will go ahead
p227_261 You can feel at home in China
p227_262 Our decision making was poor
p227_263 The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK
p227_264 The baby deserves the credit
p227_265 And they were being paid ?
p227_266 Was everything done to save people ?
p227_267 What was the matter for concern ?
p227_268 Do I think about them often ?
p227_269 Is it in the right place ?
p227_270 Did he trip ?
p227_271 In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win
p227_272 I should think so, too
p227_273 No production contract is yet in sight
p227_274 The capital costs are modest
p227_275 This is no reflection on Rangers
p227_276 I told you I was ill
p227_277 I can't get a job
p227_278 That could be in place by next year
p227_279 On the contrary they stand to gain
p227_280 Blair is very positive at European Councils
p227_281 I rejected the idea of a separate residence
p227_282 It does not work that way in Scottish football
p227_283 Every one is a winner
p227_284 There's not much money in cycling
p227_285 This court has made an order which has not been observed
p227_286 Not many companies can say that these days
p227_287 They can leave at any time
p227_288 You get a lot for your money
p227_289 As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment
p227_290 It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight
p227_291 It was an easy decision to come here
p227_292 Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years
p227_293 He ran into immediate problems with local people and police
p227_294 But the plot is not the point
p227_295 It was never a free kick
p227_296 My body is a wreck
p227_297 It's called the Supreme Court for a reason
p227_298 She has fallen in love with Scotland, however
p227_299 She failed in her action
p227_300 Stephen will get his first cap
p227_301 It's hard to see it
p227_302 Her appeal is to be heard this week
p227_303 We have to be very, very careful
p227_304 The partnership was set up during the summer
p227_305 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p227_306 It is an amazing response
p227_307 Size is not the issue
p227_308 He will address the nation this evening
p227_309 We have the easy part
p227_310 We are not increasing the number
p227_311 I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland
p227_312 They do not reflect the quality of the brand
p227_313 It could well be military
p227_314 And that culture is everywhere in Dublin
p227_315 His job was not advertised
p227_316 This is a big step up
p227_317 It goes back a long way
p227_318 The weather forecast isn't good
p227_319 We have a clean bill of health
p227_320 In that case, the children were not missing
p227_321 I have got a victim
p227_322 The judge was really nice
p227_323 If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world
p227_324 McNaughton was not so sure
p227_326 The dealer is on notice
p227_327 It is hoped to complete the merger in the summer
p227_328 The party lasted all night
p227_329 He would help me with the form
p227_330 There's still a bit to go
p227_331 I'm not worried about the critics
p227_332 I would do away with the dress code
p227_333 It is so easy to be negative
p227_334 What form did that take ?
p227_335 Are they free ?
p227_336 What are they for ?
p227_337 Is there a waiting list ?
p227_338 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p227_339 So what happens next ?
p227_340 The result was a crisis for the global financial system
p227_341 I am not obsessed with sex
p227_342 Have a look at this lot
p227_343 That decision will be made over the next couple of days
p227_344 Public opinion was split on the proposal
p227_345 The king is delighted by the honour
p227_347 I've got a sense of humour, too
p227_348 In the old days, it was easy
p227_349 I came into this world with nothing
p227_350 This is a trend which will be encouraged
p227_351 There will have to be a full inquiry
p227_352 There was no time scale
p227_353 In his absence, the council adopted the change
p227_354 Whether this return was too soon
p227_355 The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable
p227_356 They were the acts of men
p227_357 Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items
p227_358 Of course, we want to go home
p227_359 I am very interested in the subject
p227_360 He is not very big, either
p227_361 A report is expected next month
p227_363 We are encouraged by the news
p227_364 Had this been common practice ?
p227_365 What do they want us to do ?
p227_366 Is it worth it ?
p227_367 Does it matter ?
p227_368 A crucial moment has arrived
p227_369 Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side
p227_370 We need to be prepared
p227_371 Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground
p227_372 His views are hardly surprising
p227_373 The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper
p227_374 It has been made to entertain
p227_375 It is a stroke of genius
p227_376 Italy was just behind the US
p227_377 It was forced to divert
p227_378 Alex Ferguson is the same
p227_379 I would like to focus on a structure and a target
p227_380 We are still getting over it
p227_382 This will impact on us
p227_383 From our point of view, the player is free to leave
p227_384 He is in the queue
p227_385 The salary changes are long overdue
p227_386 I do not like to lose
p227_387 I am a member of the Labour Party staff
p227_388 There is no deal as yet
p227_389 In due course the deal was done
p227_390 Celtic were pleased to help
p227_391 They will fight for everything
p227_392 That's not like us at all
p227_393 You have to rely on each other
p227_394 I wanted to go out on a high
p227_395 I felt the head was very like me
p227_396 It is a terrible equation
p227_397 They have not got anyone
p227_398 I can hardly believe it
p227_399 How do you take them away ?
p227_400 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p227_401 After the match, do you ?
p227_402 Persuaded to change his mind
p228_001 Please call Stella
p228_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p228_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p228_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p228_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p228_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p228_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p228_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p228_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p228_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p228_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p228_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p228_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p228_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p228_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p228_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p228_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p228_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p228_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p228_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p228_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p228_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p228_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p228_025 It's nice to hear
p228_026 So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic
p228_027 Because we do not need it
p228_028 There's a story, too
p228_029 I feel I did not have enough time
p228_030 Life was like a timetable
p228_031 He took me on a tour of the wards
p228_032 We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude
p228_033 However, they continued in their pursuit of victory
p228_034 In both cases, I suffered a fiasco
p228_035 It was clear
p228_036 The problem is the pitch
p228_037 Indeed, he does
p228_038 President Bush is at war
p228_039 She is believed to be in South Africa
p228_040 My whole life has changed
p228_041 On this showing, they should stick with the lads
p228_042 No meaningful response was issued
p228_043 It is urgent
p228_044 Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion
p228_045 Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison
p228_046 We need to chat
p228_047 We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there
p228_048 The Scottish Parliament is also looking at similar measures
p228_049 But it might have done
p228_050 Hopefully, it will be built by next year
p228_051 Mary Archer is almost too clever
p228_052 He looks like an Afghan
p228_053 Here's a clue
p228_054 It had been in place since last July
p228_055 However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress
p228_056 That's the day job
p228_057 For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray
p228_058 That's the truth
p228_059 That is very hard, alone
p228_060 He will now seek to sell his shares in the club
p228_061 Four other charges were dropped
p228_062 They're appalled by that
p228_063 There was a battle there
p228_064 Scotland had great assets
p228_065 It's that kind of place
p228_066 Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London
p228_067 An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year
p228_068 And if he hadn't become a musician ?
p228_069 He is a young man with a new deal
p228_070 Charles Kennedy had an effective outing
p228_071 The script was funny
p228_072 Try to save us
p228_073 Sounds like The Sixth Sense ?
p228_074 Painful, but only because it's true
p228_075 They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide
p228_076 It's all I can do
p228_077 They do not work for Glasgow City Council
p228_078 Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision
p228_079 I had my suspicions
p228_081 People must remain vigilant
p228_082 Today she has been released
p228_083 That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog
p228_084 He liked to give the impression of being a hard man
p228_085 But she might be
p228_086 Nothing is yet confirmed
p228_087 Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished
p228_088 It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats
p228_089 Every time I play I do not understand their reaction
p228_090 Now the system is right behind us
p228_091 Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile
p228_092 Today I couldn't run on it
p228_093 However, it did not end that way
p228_094 This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit
p228_095 Safety was also an issue
p228_096 It is an old family habit
p228_097 I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party
p228_098 The oil companies would be asked to contribute
p228_099 It is annoying
p228_100 We could not get any possession
p228_101 I love the Dome
p228_102 We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football
p228_103 I wish I had put on a brighter tie
p228_104 He is hungry for success and I am the same
p228_105 Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights
p228_106 Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults
p228_107 It is a good day for the coalition
p228_108 A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury
p228_109 However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full
p228_110 We're not seeing an image of the person, he said
p228_111 Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill
p228_112 We have an election in eight days
p228_113 For these people, the ruling is very welcome
p228_114 They will want to perform well
p228_115 The eye was badly closed on Sunday
p228_116 However, they will only be found in the wild
p228_117 It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials
p228_118 Further protests are likely
p228_119 It's in his blood
p228_120 I don't want to use the term
p228_121 The picture is the same across Scotland
p228_122 Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals
p228_123 It is so sad
p228_124 It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option
p228_125 Until the weekend he was minister for social justice
p228_126 Who would be a referee ?
p228_127 They've got to account for it
p228_128 It is a delight on every level
p228_129 An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks
p228_130 Here, again, they were denied a voice
p228_131 I felt very strongly that England should have it
p228_132 It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged
p228_133 This plan is an agenda for action
p228_134 Despite the result, it was still a great moment
p228_135 Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince
p228_136 Offered the gold medal, he declined
p228_137 Who will attend ?
p228_138 We had a reunion last week
p228_139 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p228_140 We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties
p228_141 I was the last man to touch the ball
p228_142 He was in a great deal of pain
p228_143 Nobody in the world can get away from him
p228_144 She hopes to study in Britain one day
p228_145 Wallace was a prisoner of war
p228_146 I think he's the favourite, no question
p228_147 Who would be right ?
p228_148 It is difficult for Ali
p228_149 Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition
p228_150 Had she enjoyed the experience ?
p228_151 That should do it
p228_152 That could mean the difference between life and death in action
p228_153 It is not just about pay
p228_154 I am just trying to do my job
p228_155 It opens the door to the Champions League
p228_156 The home side didn't stand a chance
p228_157 The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous
p228_158 The weather forecast isn't good
p228_159 The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday
p228_160 There's a sense of excess in the novel
p228_161 We also enjoyed a lot of support
p228_162 It was by the numbers
p228_163 I was in daily contact
p228_164 The weather affected the other two games in Fife
p228_165 Alex has been a huge influence on the club
p228_166 It was so new, so exciting
p228_167 But we have not heard a thing from Diego
p228_168 I've put my own money into this project
p228_169 Eight months later, he was dead
p228_170 They say that vital evidence was not heard in court
p228_171 We have to move forward
p228_172 By then, however, both men were already in the US
p228_173 We have to sort it out ourselves
p228_174 The post will be unpaid
p228_175 As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead
p228_176 And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers
p228_177 We've made a couple of albums
p228_178 They might be broken, but they are not defeated
p228_179 Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling
p228_180 One season, they might do well
p228_181 However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service
p228_182 It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned
p228_183 The hotel was now for sale
p228_184 I drove the ball well
p228_185 I took the gun
p228_186 We knew nothing about it
p228_187 They will run a mile
p228_188 It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait
p228_189 Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe
p228_190 Miller was every bit as happy
p228_191 I put the drawing down
p228_192 The most important thing is to get a programme for government
p228_193 It was an odd affair, in many respects
p228_194 Florida is the pivotal state in the nation
p228_195 We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome
p228_196 We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner
p228_197 The procedure is the same in all cases
p228_198 But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections
p228_199 The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date
p228_200 I wanted to put myself on the line
p228_202 It's the same old story
p228_203 It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council
p228_204 Is that success ?
p228_205 I have a cold
p228_206 They are in the euro
p228_207 Ferguson should take note
p228_208 I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February
p228_209 Who will pay for this ?
p228_210 They've got three-quarters of the way
p228_211 He had suffered a heart attack
p228_212 A deadline is still essential
p228_213 Yet she is still the woman behind the famous man
p228_214 We will give a formal response to the report in due course
p228_215 After that time, the market itself will set the prices
p228_216 That will be vital
p228_217 Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement
p228_218 That is an important part of our role
p228_219 She should not be blamed
p228_220 I had decided to quit the show
p228_221 His third goal was superb
p228_222 It's been a good year
p228_223 The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers
p228_224 He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda
p228_225 Women were mostly notable by their absence
p228_226 The loss of a company to the industry is a blow
p228_227 Clearly, the stakes are high
p228_228 It is a gamble
p228_229 It's so special
p228_230 You take a risk
p228_231 He is severe
p228_232 We just had a go
p228_233 We are in the hat
p228_234 We were a load of rubbish
p228_235 Well, they were the unlucky ones
p228_236 On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence
p228_237 The perception is that we do not care about social issues
p228_238 I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay
p228_239 He claimed the government had lost the plot
p228_240 She was well balanced
p228_241 It's only fair
p228_242 He says that he is no different from any other man
p228_243 You can feel at home in China
p228_244 In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify
p228_245 It is a policy which has the full support of the minister
p228_246 Washington is consumed by the crisis
p228_247 He's a lovely young man
p228_248 It was a hit
p228_249 He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic
p228_250 I can't get a job
p228_251 He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather
p228_252 It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit
p228_253 That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective
p228_254 Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites
p228_255 That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match
p228_256 One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning
p228_257 Is that a serious question ?
p228_258 They are real
p228_259 They must play for each other
p228_260 I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean
p228_261 His contract was then not renewed
p228_262 He thought he had a month to cross the street
p228_263 Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday
p228_264 That decision is for the British Parliament and people
p228_265 Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races
p228_266 Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public
p228_267 It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players
p228_268 I was rubbish
p228_269 He's been here on numerous occasions
p228_270 Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry
p228_271 It's a way of life
p228_272 The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline
p228_274 It is not a process which can be completed overnight
p228_275 They were too hard
p228_276 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p228_277 Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident
p228_278 All options are open
p228_279 He will address the nation this evening
p228_280 We want to see the maximum of change
p228_281 Mr Campbell received a phone call
p228_282 He was obviously very genuine
p228_283 She said she could not believe that they had run away
p228_284 It changed my life
p228_285 The songs are just so good
p228_286 I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission
p228_287 Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen
p228_288 It became a book by itself
p228_289 The home was now under new management
p228_290 Graeme was prepared
p228_291 Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman
p228_292 He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters
p228_293 Our task is to complete the picture
p228_294 They are wrong
p228_295 It is no country for a man or woman of letters
p228_296 They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house
p228_297 You are the glory
p228_298 It's certainly different
p228_299 A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe
p228_300 We want to play at the worlds
p228_301 We have waited a long time for this
p228_302 Is there on his hands ?
p228_303 This wasn't the way it was supposed to be
p228_304 It's not even finished
p228_305 We are a peaceful people
p228_306 Kids are terrible
p228_307 The problems began a long time ago
p228_308 This film will be totally awesome
p228_309 He said she was mad
p228_310 There was some merit in that
p228_311 I am very happy to be here
p228_312 We do the same
p228_313 In his absence, the council adopted the change
p228_315 It's not long enough
p228_316 Inside, the atmosphere was quiet
p228_317 It was no secret that I wanted to sign him
p228_318 He was then replaced by Ross
p228_319 Is that an issue ?
p228_320 My first concern is for the safety of the public
p228_321 Robert is a special talent
p228_322 A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry
p228_323 You have to be able to deal with all age groups
p228_324 There was no option
p228_325 The same things will happen with GM foods
p228_326 It is a sign of hope
p228_327 Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side
p228_328 It has moved on in the last week
p228_329 The train was on time
p228_330 It is so unfair
p228_331 He has to learn
p228_332 But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party
p228_333 I've got no secret
p228_334 Tiger is the exception
p228_335 A great deal has been achieved
p228_336 It was forced to divert
p228_337 In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre
p228_338 This is a friendly match ?
p228_339 I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil
p228_340 He's a genius
p228_341 They should take their mobile phones
p228_342 It is not like working for a living
p228_343 It's the last thing on my mind
p228_344 The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police
p228_345 He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal
p228_346 That is a break with tradition
p228_347 She is free
p228_348 Everyone was in tears
p228_349 You must have a government and a good civil service
p228_350 As, indeed, they would be
p228_351 No other job in world football can compare to this one
p228_352 I expected these kind of questions
p228_353 It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives
p228_354 He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer
p228_355 It's not pretty, but it's effective
p228_356 Equity declined to comment
p228_357 He later became a respected High Court judge
p228_358 The play is based on a real-life event
p228_359 We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy
p228_360 The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland
p228_361 He put some colour into Scottish history
p228_362 It took about an hour for the gas to clear
p228_363 I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself
p228_364 It is a simple equation
p228_365 So there, we won
p228_366 But I managed
p228_367 By that time, however, it was already too late
p228_368 I am not willing to say anything about any couple
p228_369 There is no signature
p228_370 It's a record label, not a form of music
p228_371 It became a national network
p229_001 Please call Stella
p229_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p229_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p229_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p229_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p229_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p229_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p229_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p229_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p229_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p229_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p229_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p229_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p229_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p229_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p229_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p229_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p229_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p229_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p229_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p229_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p229_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p229_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p229_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p229_025 Johnson was pretty low
p229_026 He said the matter had been neglected in the past
p229_027 It's nice to hear
p229_028 Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format
p229_029 I have a theory
p229_030 It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract
p229_031 So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic
p229_032 Because we do not need it
p229_033 And we have a singer
p229_034 A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes
p229_035 It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does
p229_036 I'd like to continue that record
p229_037 However, they continued in their pursuit of victory
p229_038 In both cases, I suffered a fiasco
p229_039 They're just different
p229_040 Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack
p229_041 It is not for any other purpose
p229_042 He did not know his daughter
p229_043 People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background
p229_044 I was scared
p229_045 It will come all right
p229_046 But it took a lot of bottle
p229_047 But it is all by design
p229_048 I am just going to go for it
p229_050 We need to chat
p229_051 It is difficult for Ali
p229_052 The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids
p229_053 A recording contract is on the horizon
p229_054 Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland
p229_055 It has been a horrible, horrible time
p229_056 We've got a lot of respect for the Lions
p229_057 She's a spy !
p229_058 What was the main difference ?
p229_059 My mother is a widow
p229_060 And a film maker was born
p229_061 Art is extra
p229_062 Scotland had great assets
p229_063 I've spent a lot of time on buses
p229_064 We should have known
p229_065 It is like a river running by my home
p229_066 Try to save us
p229_067 That was the easy election
p229_068 I was as strong as a horse
p229_069 Ferguson should take note
p229_070 The girls are so lucky to be alive
p229_071 Neither it is
p229_072 She died in hospital two hours later
p229_073 It was chaotic
p229_074 It is a job creation scheme
p229_075 It works for us
p229_076 I've not thought about it
p229_077 Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time
p229_078 Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits
p229_079 Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night
p229_080 That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog
p229_081 He seems to be pleased with the picture
p229_082 Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money
p229_083 Someone who cares
p229_084 He can do everything
p229_085 By then, he was walking on water
p229_086 It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats
p229_087 Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives
p229_088 They lived for their children
p229_089 It is a lifeline
p229_090 However, it did not end that way
p229_091 We must look forward
p229_092 It is an old family habit
p229_093 Well, the big day has arrived
p229_094 I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party
p229_095 Until you hit the big games
p229_096 The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic
p229_097 The oil companies would be asked to contribute
p229_098 She's got to say something
p229_099 He is hungry for success and I am the same
p229_100 They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs
p229_101 She has so much to offer
p229_102 The court heard he drove into the path of a car
p229_103 It is a good day for the coalition
p229_104 We work on the same level
p229_105 They were outside the circle
p229_106 Two of the team became ill
p229_108 I didn't play well last year
p229_109 Before the game we went for a pint
p229_110 I'm not depressed
p229_111 It is normal
p229_112 He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald
p229_113 I don't have many friends
p229_114 He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter
p229_115 I came to complete
p229_116 I was angry
p229_117 They were behind the wheel
p229_118 The fire was above the hole
p229_119 It's not fair
p229_120 We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail
p229_121 On this showing, they should stick with the lads
p229_122 Maybe this battle has been
p229_123 I'm delighted about that
p229_124 I joined a group
p229_125 It is rubbish
p229_126 Who would be a referee ?
p229_127 It was my own fault and I lost a lot of belief
p229_128 The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment
p229_129 An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks
p229_130 Here, again, they were denied a voice
p229_131 There will be no shortage of quality applicants
p229_132 It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged
p229_133 She really suffered for her art
p229_134 Next season for every manager is a long time away
p229_135 It's an amazing landscape !
p229_136 So the European elections are extremely important
p229_137 He is slightly confused
p229_138 Despite the result, it was still a great moment
p229_139 If not, a deal could take many months
p229_140 They took a risk
p229_141 Government will intervene
p229_142 What will happen then ?
p229_143 We never said that we would walk through the third division
p229_144 On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door
p229_145 This represents a tough game for us
p229_146 I was the last man to touch the ball
p229_147 Nobody in the world can get away from him
p229_148 Three penalties were given
p229_149 In this case, the farmer had actually given permission
p229_150 We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football
p229_151 Who would be right ?
p229_152 We just had a go
p229_153 He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative
p229_154 Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition
p229_155 He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context
p229_156 Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power
p229_157 It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment
p229_158 The home side didn't stand a chance
p229_159 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p229_160 Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment
p229_161 We also enjoyed a lot of support
p229_162 It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse
p229_163 It was by the numbers
p229_164 I knew he was good
p229_165 He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused
p229_166 This year, this month, will be special for Torrance
p229_167 Inside, the atmosphere was quiet
p229_168 Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes
p229_169 Was this element always there ?
p229_170 Alex has been a huge influence on the club
p229_171 A new season has offered a fresh start for both men
p229_172 I will tell you
p229_173 A Labour insider said it was far too close to call
p229_174 It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened
p229_175 Military action is the only option we have on the table today
p229_176 We have to move forward
p229_177 It's that sort of night
p229_178 Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland
p229_179 It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful
p229_180 The post will be unpaid
p229_181 Does that put pressure on us ?
p229_182 It is a memorial
p229_183 It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate
p229_184 They thought they had found a home
p229_185 One season, they might do well
p229_186 Is Saddam a threat ?
p229_187 The home was now under new management
p229_188 He asked me in a tolerance zone
p229_189 The hotel was now for sale
p229_190 I drove the ball well
p229_191 It is the whole package
p229_192 I have the first six months of next season to prove myself
p229_193 We knew nothing about it
p229_194 It is minute
p229_195 Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted
p229_196 Four policemen were wounded
p229_197 What has caused the demise of singing ?
p229_198 Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval
p229_199 Suddenly, the rugby world had changed
p229_200 I've got good news and bad news for you
p229_201 We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner
p229_202 People will ask about us
p229_203 The work between the musicians and the fire is very important
p229_204 Last night was a key episode
p229_205 Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament
p229_206 It wasn't to be
p229_207 I wanted to put myself on the line
p229_209 I came home by ambulance
p229_210 It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions
p229_211 It's the same old story
p229_212 But we are not immune to the problem
p229_213 He has a lot of experience as captain in his career
p229_214 The sisters also became the top two players in the world
p229_215 The procedures were not in place
p229_216 It was worth a photograph
p229_217 We will give a formal response to the report in due course
p229_218 After that time, the market itself will set the prices
p229_219 Saddam Hussein is a devil
p229_220 That is an important part of our role
p229_221 She should not be blamed
p229_222 We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence
p229_223 I am delighted for Simon
p229_224 I had decided to quit the show
p229_225 The FBI could become involved
p229_226 However, Dundee deserved to win this game
p229_227 For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon
p229_228 On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football
p229_229 The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument
p229_230 Who was on the panel ?
p229_231 We've got the bronze
p229_232 Saturday is gone
p229_233 At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher
p229_234 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p229_235 The boy is no longer with us
p229_236 The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia
p229_237 The track is currently covered in snow
p229_238 I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision
p229_239 You should always be able to get out in some direction
p229_240 We are so proud
p229_241 We were a load of rubbish
p229_242 The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days
p229_243 It's an idea
p229_244 On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence
p229_245 The sanctions are about collective punishment
p229_246 We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there
p229_247 The perception is that we do not care about social issues
p229_248 The problem in Norway is outside the National
p229_249 The letters are going out today
p229_250 It's only fair
p229_251 Chambers said he would accept the place
p229_252 Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries
p229_253 It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak
p229_254 It was a hit
p229_255 A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe
p229_256 This year I understood
p229_257 He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather
p229_258 Kirkwood was arrested
p229_259 This is a big club
p229_260 That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match
p229_261 I was happily surprised
p229_262 They must play for each other
p229_263 The pensioners did not want to know
p229_264 He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention
p229_265 Today we can say that a new era has begun
p229_266 That is highly unfair
p229_267 The warning is timely
p229_268 Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention
p229_269 That decision is for the British Parliament and people
p229_270 They are never here
p229_271 I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset
p229_272 He was also married with two children
p229_273 It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players
p229_274 We're in shock
p229_275 Our objective is to tackle poverty
p229_277 It's a way of life
p229_278 She has fallen in love with Scotland, however
p229_279 He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry
p229_280 I am an estate agent
p229_281 People have no choice
p229_282 They were on holiday in Egypt
p229_283 It was a privilege to work for him
p229_284 In fact, he was talking about the survival business
p229_285 If not, he should go home
p229_286 For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray
p229_287 I saw it at a ruck
p229_288 I felt like I was a child
p229_289 What would be the timetable for withdrawal ?
p229_290 The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible
p229_292 We have other options
p229_293 I do not think this family will ever get over this
p229_294 It shows a contempt by him for the industry
p229_295 These figures are truly awful
p229_296 Sunday's game was not a trial
p229_297 Disruption will be kept to a minimum
p229_298 The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland
p229_300 I was brought up in a mining background
p229_301 I thought it was my only chance
p229_302 Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman
p229_303 The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office
p229_304 The most important thing is to get a programme for government
p229_305 There is no openness
p229_306 This is a war over our home
p229_307 In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge
p229_308 It's just not funny !
p229_309 It is no country for a man or woman of letters
p229_310 The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn
p229_311 You are the glory
p229_312 However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart
p229_313 Let's hope it's an investment in the future
p229_314 It's certainly different
p229_315 O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place
p229_316 This is the culture change in medicine
p229_318 It's about my time as a guitarist
p229_319 There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh
p229_320 It's not even finished
p229_322 It should be equal
p229_323 Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans
p229_324 We are very strongly behind the bid
p229_325 In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times
p229_326 I am very happy to be here
p229_328 It was no secret that I wanted to sign him
p229_329 On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research
p229_330 It could have gone either way
p229_331 He was then replaced by Ross
p229_332 I'd like to take the plunge
p229_333 She did not attend the courtroom
p229_334 It is difficult to get into the team at the moment
p229_335 He told the court
p229_336 The team for the first game could be this one
p229_337 They haven't got a hope
p229_338 It has moved on in the last week
p229_339 Gaelic provision continued to be good
p229_340 He did a good job
p229_341 I'm so pleased the show has won a prize
p229_342 Today she has been released
p229_343 These days are long gone
p229_344 They might be broken, but they are not defeated
p229_345 But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party
p229_346 Indeed, it was magical
p229_347 I've got no secret
p229_348 Look at the witnesses
p229_349 The visual arts committee took this decision in December
p229_350 I'm very lucky
p229_351 They may yet have the last laugh
p229_352 Everything was an effort
p229_353 This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required
p229_354 Like his acting, it was an accident
p229_355 It is long gone
p229_356 It's the last thing on my mind
p229_357 Tell us about it
p229_358 There is a cup final at stake
p229_359 That is a break with tradition
p229_360 It was very formal
p229_361 They say that vital evidence was not heard in court
p229_362 In addition, it was in breach of natural justice
p229_363 It benefits the whole family
p229_364 It was fit for royalty
p229_365 We are looking for perfection
p229_366 It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives
p229_367 The group is due to publish its report in the autumn
p229_368 I am a star
p229_369 We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors
p229_370 He could make it
p229_371 He later became a respected High Court judge
p229_373 For one veteran, the memories remain vivid
p229_374 It is not too late to get on board
p229_376 It is a simple equation
p229_377 Talks are progressing
p229_378 They play together perfectly
p229_379 It's a long process
p229_380 Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter
p229_381 It does not even have a staff shortage
p229_382 However, the players should have a voice in these matters
p229_384 It is obvious that we are engaged in a war
p229_386 Three years ago he would have been
p229_387 That team is due to be announced this morning
p229_388 It has been a lovely family occasion
p229_389 That's the name of the game, though
p229_390 There were no casualties
p229_391 A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting
p229_392 Yet the data is compelling
p230_001 Please call Stella
p230_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p230_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p230_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p230_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p230_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p230_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p230_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p230_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p230_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p230_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p230_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p230_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky
p230_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p230_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p230_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p230_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p230_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p230_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p230_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p230_025 It is on the internet
p230_026 Smoking is also very important
p230_027 He has the courage of the unaware
p230_028 Life was like a timetable
p230_029 It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does
p230_030 Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy
p230_031 I'm so happy that she did
p230_032 The wedding was in Edinburgh
p230_033 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p230_034 He really is a lovely man
p230_035 The staff are as good as any staff in the city
p230_036 This represents a tough game for us
p230_037 The boy is no longer with us
p230_038 They said she was stable
p230_039 This will save interest charges
p230_040 Well, he is an artist
p230_041 He looks like an Afghan
p230_042 People want to see me on the screen
p230_043 The big problem is the lack of grass
p230_044 That was the theory, anyway
p230_045 I was inspired by two things
p230_046 If not, he should go home
p230_047 I must take a seat
p230_048 It was bound to happen
p230_049 We have to bring in new players
p230_050 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p230_051 I have made that offer
p230_052 None has ever been found
p230_053 Four other charges were dropped
p230_054 We should be able to cope
p230_055 There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement
p230_056 We will pay their bills
p230_057 You should consider whether you want to be in this film
p230_058 It was exactly four months away
p230_059 He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture
p230_060 It's not covered by the insurance
p230_061 But the challenge is in the US
p230_062 Robin Williams is very subdued
p230_063 The tournament has now been cancelled
p230_064 They would now be able to look forward with confidence
p230_065 Both sides have been hit by injury
p230_066 He also received a medal of honour
p230_068 It may be that lifestyle is behind it
p230_069 It is a job creation scheme
p230_070 It looks like a hit
p230_071 What do we do ?
p230_072 Why do it otherwise ?
p230_073 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p230_074 However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made
p230_075 After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction
p230_076 Consumer confidence remains an issue
p230_077 Last week, he was taken into hospital
p230_078 This is a true story
p230_079 By then, he was walking on water
p230_080 It's so hard to shift
p230_081 They lived for their children
p230_083 It might change your life
p230_084 You are a great player
p230_085 However, it did not end that way
p230_086 We will deal with the refugees
p230_087 It was not an insult
p230_088 You might not make it
p230_089 However, a decision should be made before the end of August
p230_090 I did not have a bet on myself
p230_091 The conclusion is the same
p230_092 He was prepared for this
p230_093 But I know the course
p230_094 You are like an animal
p230_095 We intend to change the model
p230_096 It was some time before she found out he was safe
p230_097 Two of the team became ill
p230_099 It has been a nightmare of frustration
p230_100 But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant
p230_101 Before the game we went for a pint
p230_102 This was a good move for me
p230_103 It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials
p230_104 I was just appalled at the way they behaved
p230_105 It is close to call
p230_106 It is an impressive record
p230_107 It is a total and utter change of culture
p230_108 He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter
p230_109 Abbey National is an option
p230_110 The arrival of the Scottish Premier League has also presented a problem
p230_112 We have the mental strength
p230_113 You can spend money on housing
p230_114 That admission is not surprising
p230_115 I can't even get into the A team
p230_116 Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership
p230_117 Which can happen any time
p230_118 It is too pretty, it is too small
p230_119 But this time we can have no excuses
p230_120 They are very happy with the new settlement
p230_121 The abuse of elderly people was appalling
p230_122 Something will be done by corporate bodies
p230_123 We did what we had to do
p230_124 She was also very brave
p230_125 On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door
p230_126 We must recognise that this outfit is unique
p230_127 The opposite is the case
p230_128 He was a home referee
p230_129 This is a successful outcome
p230_130 Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray
p230_131 She died at her home
p230_132 Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition
p230_133 Five minutes later, the home team were back in front
p230_134 It was a piece of art
p230_135 I would relish the prospect
p230_137 These men are a part of India
p230_138 I was caught out a little bit
p230_139 The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday
p230_140 I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery
p230_141 It has to be an event
p230_142 It was deployed in the Gulf War
p230_143 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p230_144 The first thing is to assess the damage that has been done
p230_145 She has gone to the Catholic school
p230_146 It was by the numbers
p230_147 I am not going to make any further comment, apart from that
p230_148 This year, this month, will be special for Torrance
p230_149 However, he was later released without charge
p230_150 This might seem like an outrageous assertion
p230_151 These days are long gone
p230_152 I'm afraid to say anything
p230_153 We are still getting over it
p230_154 It has to be now
p230_155 It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened
p230_156 You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues
p230_157 They will do their own thing
p230_158 You had to go and see him
p230_159 So what is the campaign about ?
p230_160 And does it ?
p230_161 Are you from the rugby ?
p230_162 Had I heard ?
p230_163 Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo
p230_164 Our position remains the same
p230_165 Nobody did in those days
p230_166 We believe in the medium term
p230_167 It's nice to be nice
p230_168 To get good people, you need to offer them enough money
p230_169 On the month the weakness was across the board
p230_170 One season, they might do well
p230_171 Manchester United can win the European Cup this season
p230_172 First and foremost, the game is entirely different
p230_173 But he has a lifeline
p230_174 Phase one was a shambles
p230_175 City sentiment is in his favour
p230_176 I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal
p230_177 At the top level, the salaries are far too high
p230_178 Tomorrow is a new day
p230_179 It makes no influence on the public
p230_180 She has left the island
p230_181 He played it like a veteran
p230_182 I have spoken to head office
p230_183 They will run a mile
p230_184 It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area
p230_185 Our destiny is in our own hands
p230_186 He prefers to play for them
p230_188 He lives in a neighbouring village
p230_189 It was an odd affair, in many respects
p230_190 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p230_191 We represent a wide range of society
p230_192 We always felt we could win
p230_194 This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds
p230_195 It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however
p230_196 Neither side would reveal the details of the offer
p230_198 I made a terrible start
p230_199 The result is called a patent
p230_200 We played them off the pitch
p230_201 Racism has no place in any sport
p230_202 Tommy is not a problem
p230_203 The sanctions are about collective punishment
p230_204 This is a holy place
p230_205 He had suffered a heart attack
p230_206 The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office
p230_207 We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead
p230_208 This will take several weeks
p230_209 The research is published in the journal, Nature
p230_210 We have an election in eight days
p230_211 Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match
p230_212 There is no quick fix
p230_213 All will be revealed in due course
p230_214 We used to live with dignity in our country
p230_215 The most exciting room is the final one of the show
p230_216 He has made his base in Spain
p230_217 My life is in the ballet
p230_218 Basically, they have to come up with the offer
p230_219 It's all change at Kilmarnock
p230_220 His second was a beauty
p230_221 What do we want to do that for ?
p230_222 Does the name matter ?
p230_223 How do you get it back ?
p230_224 What are you not good at ?
p230_225 The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday
p230_226 However, Dundee deserved to win this game
p230_227 It was a day for records
p230_228 He remains a main board director of Royal
p230_230 That has been the easy part
p230_231 Things were so intense in the studio
p230_232 I was not sure whether I had won
p230_233 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p230_234 So far, the problems have occurred in the US
p230_235 It is the voice of the survivors
p230_236 It had so much to do with output
p230_237 Must have been at the bar
p230_238 She died in middle age
p230_239 No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden
p230_240 They need to win a trophy
p230_241 Half the young people had had contact with the police
p230_242 It is possible to be too good
p230_243 In many ways, that is as important
p230_244 Here is a question for you
p230_245 I was just a kid
p230_246 Sadly, it sounds as if it is
p230_247 Hospitals are for the ill
p230_248 However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart
p230_249 Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter
p230_250 We have to compete at our own level
p230_251 They showed a lot of heart
p230_252 This gives a financial incentive to switch
p230_253 It might be sad, but it's a fact
p230_254 She took them for a term
p230_255 Kingfisher can afford to wait
p230_257 Nato was not a love affair
p230_258 Defensive stocks attracted some interest
p230_259 Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries
p230_260 In fact, we were all over the shop
p230_261 You can feel at home in China
p230_262 Persuaded to change his mind
p230_263 Either way, the investor retains the premium
p230_264 It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak
p230_265 In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win
p230_266 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p230_267 I should think so, too
p230_268 Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me
p230_269 I've had no discussions with the chairman of the board
p230_270 I was ready for this
p230_271 On the contrary they stand to gain
p230_272 They are interior designers and architects
p230_273 That should be the subject matter of a public debate
p230_274 We feel very good about it
p230_276 It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner
p230_277 It is also very valuable
p230_278 None of this work is guaranteed
p230_279 There is a case to answer
p230_280 We're trying to get rounded performers
p230_281 They can leave at any time
p230_282 And they were being paid ?
p230_283 was everything done to save people ?
p230_284 What was the matter for concern ?
p230_285 Do I think about them often ?
p230_286 That was a gold medal for certain
p230_287 You get a lot for your money
p230_288 Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt
p230_289 In that moment, I was happy
p230_290 The actor has met with Mandela
p230_291 It was never a free kick
p230_292 It is a recipe for success
p230_293 I would rather look at him
p230_295 It's got to come from me
p230_296 It took a month and a half to film
p230_297 The cause of the accident remained unclear
p230_298 It is a symbolic concert
p230_299 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p230_300 Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished
p230_302 He is at war with his knee
p230_303 Again the parallel with football can be drawn
p230_304 I was there five months ago
p230_305 You have to see it like this
p230_306 Rugby is now just like football
p230_307 It could well be military
p230_308 His job was not advertised
p230_309 There is an element of racism in Scotland
p230_310 We have a clean bill of health
p230_311 And we can do it
p230_312 The songs are just so good
p230_313 The casting is as perfect
p230_314 I can hardly believe it
p230_315 I must do something about it
p230_316 Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear
p230_317 If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world
p230_318 They are not left wing
p230_319 McNaughton was not so sure
p230_321 It is a road of death
p230_322 The party lasted all night
p230_323 The group is not paying a dividend
p230_324 We were on our way
p230_325 I was as strong as a horse
p230_326 That meant the search was unlawful
p230_327 We have a good healthy debate
p230_328 I would do away with the dress code
p230_329 We are on a four-year mission
p230_330 This is a historic occasion
p230_331 This ruling is a farce
p230_332 I can see their argument
p230_333 After some discussion they did
p230_334 It was always an option
p230_335 Does that put pressure on us ?
p230_336 Did it work ?
p230_337 Do you think we are a top nation ?
p230_338 Public opinion was split on the proposal
p230_339 The election is total confusion and chaos
p230_340 You may have a short memory
p230_341 Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars
p230_342 In the old days, it was easy
p230_343 There was some merit in that
p230_344 That is a trend which will be encouraged
p230_345 The airport was even different
p230_346 Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons
p230_347 We think all other measures are not exhausted
p230_348 There was no time scale
p230_349 Last night, he pledged to clear his name
p230_350 On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research
p230_351 He is not very big, either
p230_352 I have a moral dilemma
p230_353 Even the one she loved
p230_354 You have no chance of planning permission
p230_355 We are encouraged by the news
p230_356 In addition, certain areas closed at certain times
p230_357 The professor said the results were positive
p230_358 In fact, it is deeply unpleasant
p230_359 Three years ago he would have been
p230_360 Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground
p230_361 The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper
p230_362 I am a lucky man
p230_363 Nobody else was with me
p230_364 We put our bid in last night
p230_365 Alex Ferguson is the same
p230_366 George Mitchell is trying to close the gap
p230_367 But BA said the prediction was premature
p230_368 Like his acting, it was an accident
p230_369 They have broken the promise
p230_370 We are really good friends
p230_371 My goal is quite simple
p230_372 This is a major championship
p230_373 It's going to be fun
p230_374 She is now on the back benches
p230_375 Scrutiny by European Parliament is limited
p230_376 This hasn't happened in a vacuum
p230_377 Both of those promises have already been honoured
p230_378 We are a Scottish company
p230_379 We will win the argument
p230_380 Tomorrow will be a different game entirely
p230_381 It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage
p230_382 I always knew she was funny
p230_383 He is a close friend of Gordon Brown
p230_384 The marshall at the turn was great
p230_385 If you can get it
p230_386 On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options
p230_387 There was a substantial explosion
p230_388 The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account
p230_389 He could face a jail sentence
p230_390 That is the consistent approach of the Government
p230_391 This big issue is whether it can be enforced
p230_392 Clark is back on top form
p230_393 Motion described it as a unique event
p230_394 I had a fortunate war
p230_395 Are they free ?
p230_396 What are they for ?
p230_397 Is there a waiting list ?
p230_398 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p230_399 That investment has now been secured
p230_400 It is a large number
p230_401 You will not feel a thing
p230_402 I've never seen a game like it
p230_404 It does not even have a staff shortage
p230_405 It was a bank holiday, after all
p230_406 We're obviously disturbed by this case
p230_407 The casualties were not named
p230_408 It is a temptation which should be resisted
p230_409 It had been on the cards
p230_410 The second goal was superb
p230_411 Treatment is not an issue with these people
p230_413 Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope
p230_414 It is the old story
p230_415 This should put downward pressure on inflation
p230_416 No date has been set for a meeting
p230_417 We have to build a new team in the minimum of time
p231_001 Please call Stella
p231_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p231_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p231_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p231_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p231_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p231_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p231_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p231_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p231_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p231_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p231_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p231_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p231_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p231_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p231_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky
p231_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p231_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p231_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p231_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p231_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p231_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p231_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p231_025 On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value
p231_026 I'd just like to play
p231_027 Because we do not need it
p231_028 There was a rush of water
p231_029 Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted
p231_030 That deal is a joke
p231_031 The Premier League has been a huge success
p231_032 If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it
p231_033 It carried a double message
p231_034 That means an extra two years
p231_035 I became a widow overnight
p231_036 But he can turn on the charm
p231_037 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p231_038 The man became a reporter
p231_039 Mr Blair last night attended his weekly audience with the Queen
p231_040 Last year, I was pretty bad
p231_041 Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man
p231_042 Among them are many criminals
p231_043 He looks like an Afghan
p231_044 He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted
p231_045 I guess I was lucky, though
p231_046 I was inspired by two things
p231_047 A win is a win
p231_048 There was no safety net
p231_049 There's nothing we could do about this
p231_050 It is a symbolic concert
p231_051 We keep an eye on it
p231_052 We have not given up hope
p231_053 The cuts were made within an hour of each other
p231_054 She said she was really sorry
p231_055 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p231_056 Italy is a beautiful place
p231_057 Four other charges were dropped
p231_058 We should be able to cope
p231_059 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p231_061 So is that it, then ?
p231_062 Do I have a favourite ?
p231_063 What do we do ?
p231_064 It was a lovely experience
p231_065 The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow
p231_066 We will pay their bills
p231_067 Only water is currently allowed
p231_068 He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture
p231_069 We need to increase the membership
p231_070 This is an exciting new venture
p231_071 He highlighted a lack of staff
p231_072 Then followed a bout of flu
p231_073 Both sides have been hit by injury
p231_074 Both men were on one-year contracts
p231_076 That would be too easy
p231_078 After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction
p231_079 Both agreed on the success of the event
p231_080 Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat
p231_081 On Saturday, it was much the same
p231_082 It's so hard to shift
p231_083 They lived for their children
p231_085 However, it did not end that way
p231_086 Strathclyde Police declined to comment
p231_087 It is an old family habit
p231_088 He's been hit by it
p231_089 However, a decision should be made before the end of August
p231_090 I saw the whole thing
p231_091 But I know the course
p231_092 Their attitude is all wrong
p231_093 We must stop it with the golf ball
p231_094 You are like an animal
p231_095 This is the logic of punishment assaults
p231_097 We should recognise others have done a good job
p231_098 We live by the rule of law
p231_099 Two of the team became ill
p231_100 No, the equipment is extra
p231_101 That time is not now, however
p231_102 It's not a quick fix
p231_103 Why do it otherwise ?
p231_104 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p231_105 So, did she meet him ?
p231_106 So what is the campaign about ?
p231_107 And does it ?
p231_108 Before the game we went for a pint
p231_109 We needed financial backing to get it off the ground
p231_110 You'd better believe it
p231_111 New Year will be very busy
p231_112 There's still plenty time left
p231_113 It proved a good decision
p231_114 Maybe this battle has been
p231_115 January is a bad time of year
p231_116 I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar
p231_117 It is much as it has been described
p231_118 Then again, we could have
p231_119 It is a delight on every level
p231_120 There were no grounds for his action
p231_121 I was just a child
p231_122 We should not be surprised
p231_123 It was not a finale he would want to remember
p231_124 Despite the result, it was still a great moment
p231_125 That period was a struggle
p231_126 It is too pretty, it is too small
p231_127 This should begin in October
p231_128 That is far too high
p231_129 If not, a deal could take many months
p231_130 It plans to return to this field
p231_131 They made such decisions in London
p231_132 Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll
p231_133 It is a common problem
p231_134 You're a gambling man
p231_135 We must recognise that this outfit is unique
p231_136 He is a great addition to our team
p231_137 This is a successful outcome
p231_138 In this case, the farmer had actually given permission
p231_139 Put yourself in the position of being a referee
p231_140 I think he's the favourite, no question
p231_141 I miss the freedom that I had
p231_142 It only increased the support for him
p231_143 Anyone can do the sums
p231_144 Five minutes later, the home team were back in front
p231_145 It opens the door to the Champions League
p231_146 It has become a way of life
p231_147 The whole industry is a shambles
p231_148 There's only one team in Ayrshire
p231_149 It was deployed in the Gulf War
p231_150 We have a clean bill of health
p231_151 It is not normal practice
p231_152 The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms
p231_153 He was asked to quit
p231_154 A new school will be built
p231_155 The strong pound also took its toll
p231_156 It is a terrible tragedy
p231_157 He was right into football from an early age
p231_158 It is not like us
p231_159 What happened in that game ?
p231_160 Are you going to win ?
p231_161 Was it the wife ?
p231_162 Why change it ?
p231_163 What do we want to do that for ?
p231_164 He was in great spirits
p231_165 We have a budget in March
p231_166 You've been a great audience
p231_167 It is simply not true
p231_168 Well, this article is a bit like that
p231_169 It is really good news
p231_170 We've made a couple of albums
p231_171 To get good people, you need to offer them enough money
p231_172 My life has been destroyed
p231_173 I always felt they played for me
p231_174 One season, they might do well
p231_175 First and foremost, the game is entirely different
p231_176 This much I can tell you
p231_177 The Hibs manager is no fool
p231_178 We are the gateway to justice
p231_179 But one was not enough
p231_180 I have spoken to head office
p231_181 I am not ready to walk away
p231_183 The shooting created panic in the street
p231_184 So many people will be affected by this
p231_185 As many as the market will support
p231_186 They need to look after themselves
p231_188 This is the time to use it
p231_189 You know the sort of thing
p231_190 I'm interested in interesting work
p231_191 We represent a wide range of society
p231_192 People will ask about us
p231_193 Neither side would reveal the details of the offer
p231_194 This should put downward pressure on inflation
p231_195 On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door
p231_196 I came home by ambulance
p231_197 I suggest a new plan
p231_198 It was a moment of madness
p231_199 Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon
p231_200 Libya is an easy target
p231_201 Does the name matter ?
p231_202 how do you get it back ?
p231_203 What are you no good at ?
p231_205 Who was she ?
p231_206 It gave no further details
p231_207 You've caught a serial killer
p231_208 I won't make an official complaint
p231_209 We are a new department
p231_210 It was worth a photograph
p231_211 They are looking at flotation
p231_212 Which isn't a bad idea
p231_213 We have an election in eight days
p231_214 He also presented You Bet!
p231_215 That might help a bit
p231_216 I had decided to quit the show
p231_217 He has a lot of skill
p231_218 I've wanted to buy one for the National Gallery
p231_219 However, Dundee deserved to win this game
p231_220 And the World Cup has not even begun
p231_221 The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo
p231_222 That you can do it
p231_223 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p231_224 They all made the European Ryder Cup team
p231_225 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p231_226 This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely
p231_228 We played them off the pitch
p231_229 So far, the problems have occurred in the US
p231_230 They are the innocent victims
p231_231 Paterson can afford to be generous
p231_232 She died in middle age
p231_233 I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight
p231_234 It is set in Paris
p231_235 The irony was not lost
p231_236 Sadly, it sounds as if it is
p231_237 Hospitals are for the ill
p231_238 The minister is the engineer
p231_239 My future is in the marathon
p231_240 It is now the big brother
p231_241 The parties have no contact
p231_242 She took them for a term
p231_243 Nato was not a love affair
p231_244 He is due in Israel tomorrow
p231_245 You can feel at home in China
p231_246 His is a global perspective
p231_247 Persuaded to change his mind
p231_248 Either way, the investor retains the premium
p231_249 This ruling is a farce
p231_250 The baby deserves the credit
p231_251 Washington is consumed by the crisis
p231_252 But they were never expected to last
p231_253 It was a cry for help
p231_254 No production contract is yet in sight
p231_255 Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland
p231_256 A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe
p231_257 He admitted that he knew nothing about it
p231_258 It seems a shame to leave it
p231_259 It was the climax of the thing
p231_260 The concerns are the same
p231_261 I can't get a job
p231_262 And they were being paid ?
p231_263 was everything done to save people ?
p231_264 What was the matter for concern ?
p231_265 Do I think about them often ?
p231_266 Is it in the right place ?
p231_267 Did he trip ?
p231_268 I've had the time of my life
p231_269 The property is owned by Glasgow City Council
p231_270 On the contrary they stand to gain
p231_271 I thought he might have been a bit
p231_272 This news came after the stock market closed on Monday
p231_273 I'd never run for them
p231_274 It is a mark of respect from the inmates
p231_275 It does not work that way in Scottish football
p231_276 These figures are truly terrible
p231_277 Share prices have fallen for three years in a row
p231_278 The joint bid is still on course
p231_279 At first I thought I was gone
p231_280 The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack
p231_281 They can leave at any time
p231_282 That view has not altered
p231_283 You get a lot for your money
p231_284 Blair also had a penalty
p231_285 It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight
p231_286 Frankly, we should all have such problems
p231_288 The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline
p231_289 She has fallen in love with Scotland, however
p231_290 They were on holiday in Egypt
p231_291 It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday
p231_292 I've lost all confidence
p231_293 This could be a mistake
p231_294 Once again, they would be wrong
p231_295 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p231_296 It's all designed to speed up the service
p231_297 He will address the nation this evening
p231_298 They have shown a great desire and attitude
p231_299 I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh
p231_300 But it is up again
p231_301 Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled
p231_302 It could well be military
p231_303 I was just so determined
p231_304 That was the difference between the sides
p231_305 The judge was really nice
p231_307 You are a different people
p231_308 Disruption will be kept to a minimum
p231_309 He is still in shock
p231_310 McNaughton was not so sure
p231_312 I thought it was my only chance
p231_313 I thought he did very well
p231_314 I'm not making any comment at all
p231_315 Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter
p231_316 We're on our way
p231_317 They come to enjoy themselves
p231_318 That meant the search was unlawful
p231_319 They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house
p231_320 However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart
p231_322 We want to play at the worlds
p231_323 However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals
p231_324 We have got no money to go anywhere
p231_325 Have a look at this lot
p231_326 That decision will be made over the next couple of days
p231_327 The king is delighted by the honour
p231_328 It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register
p231_329 The problems began a long time ago
p231_330 I am not sure about the rate of progress
p231_331 To beat the European champion is quite nice
p231_332 In the old days, it was easy
p231_333 However, the groups denied the claims
p231_334 She is now on the back benches
p231_336 I think it's about time
p231_337 The airport was even different
p231_338 There was no time scale
p231_339 In his absence, the council adopted the change
p231_340 At first, the youngster was not keen
p231_341 The figures are bad, but not that bad
p231_342 Last night, he pledged to clear his name
p231_343 Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items
p231_344 He was then replaced by Ross
p231_345 Finally came the moment of truth
p231_346 We are encouraged by the news
p231_347 What form did that take ?
p231_348 Are they free ?
p231_349 What are they for ?
p231_350 Is there a waiting list ?
p231_351 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p231_352 So what happens next ?
p231_353 The units will not be replaced
p231_354 Neither man has been charged
p231_355 Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side
p231_357 Look at the Liberal Democrats
p231_358 I am a lucky man
p231_359 But they have taken the lesson to heart
p231_360 I've always been a sensitive
p231_361 Glasgow is a friendly city
p231_362 You did not see it
p231_363 We live on an island
p231_364 It is not real life
p231_365 Neither woman has been named
p231_366 They should take their mobile phones
p231_367 You need a licence to run a pub
p231_368 We regret that they're brought in the first place
p231_369 Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months
p231_370 This is a major championship
p231_371 The result is called a patent
p231_372 But we finished the show
p231_373 They were to blame for the first two goals
p231_374 There is no deal as yet
p231_375 Here is a weather forecast for the weekend
p231_376 We were given a break
p231_377 In due course the deal was done
p231_378 to have products for their needs
p231_379 The pair are very much in love
p231_380 We will win the argument
p231_381 Had this been common practice ?
p231_382 What do they want us to do ?
p231_383 Is it worth it ?
p231_384 Does it matter ?
p231_385 You have to rely on each other
p231_386 The Internet is no substitute for customer service
p231_387 I wanted to go out on a high
p231_388 Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors
p231_389 That time may never be broken
p231_390 It was fit for royalty
p231_391 The response from them was good
p231_392 There was a substantial explosion
p231_393 But we are very near
p231_394 That's as good as it gets
p231_395 A review is under way
p231_396 He put some colour into Scottish history
p231_397 This big issue is whether it can be enforced
p231_398 They have failed to deliver
p231_399 Clark is back on top form
p231_400 I had a fortunate war
p231_401 She is in their hands
p231_402 It is a large number
p231_403 It does not even have a staff shortage
p231_404 It is hard to understand
p231_405 It was a bank holiday, after all
p231_406 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p231_407 There was an element of frustration
p231_408 I should think so, too
p231_409 How do you take them away ?
p231_411 After the match, do you ?
p231_412 I will always remember the horrible images
p231_414 They are looking for profit
p231_415 I remain a buyer of the shares
p231_416 There is some light in the tunnel
p231_417 He liked the weather, the courses, the food
p231_418 There will be widespread support on all sides
p231_419 The case will now go to appeal
p231_420 Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope
p231_421 There is a solution, she believes
p231_422 Yet the data is compelling
p231_423 It was important to win the singles
p231_424 The road was closed for several hours
p231_426 My aim is a top six finish
p231_427 I would love to think that she could win
p231_428 Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime
p231_429 He is on the wrong side
p231_430 It was a breathtaking moment
p231_431 I was in jail for five years
p231_432 I never had a childhood
p231_433 It is based on a true story
p231_434 But it can be done
p231_435 I never won a penny throughout my career
p231_436 There will be no excuses on Wednesday
p231_437 The growth potential is enormous
p231_438 They are not left wing
p231_439 The British government does not want to know
p231_440 They said they were only young men
p231_441 We shall not forget him
p231_442 The people are the hero
p231_443 They made a huge impression on me
p231_444 It's never easy to win an Olympic gold medal
p231_445 It sounded like a bomb
p231_446 Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey
p231_447 We've got a good management record
p231_448 Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt
p231_449 And we might go back
p231_450 We have just got to keep his feet on the ground
p231_451 We went straight into the bedroom
p231_452 Its future is no longer in question
p231_453 We put our bid in last night
p231_454 Today, he is in the same position as four years ago
p231_456 They have to be met
p231_457 We think a lot of Allan McGregor
p231_458 She has reached the top of her profession
p231_459 But he has a lifeline
p231_460 A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing
p231_461 They were good years for him
p231_462 Let that be their memorial
p231_463 Nine days later, he suffered another attack
p231_464 Driving has been the key
p231_465 She has now been registered as disabled
p231_466 He is well respected by his colleagues
p231_467 Classes must be reduced by half
p231_468 War is not the action
p231_469 However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action
p231_470 It is too early to speculate
p231_471 Dennis was not so sure
p231_472 He felt it was the right time
p231_473 It was clear on Thursday
p231_474 The casting of her husband was an accident
p231_475 It was all in a short period of time
p231_476 That was the first time I worked with Richard
p232_001 Please call Stella
p232_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p232_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p232_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p232_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p232_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p232_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p232_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p232_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p232_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p232_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p232_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p232_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p232_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p232_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p232_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p232_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p232_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p232_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p232_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p232_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p232_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p232_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p232_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p232_025 Johnson was pretty low
p232_026 But it failed
p232_027 Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format
p232_028 They should be so lucky
p232_029 Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected
p232_030 They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday
p232_031 It's a matter of balance
p232_032 They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide
p232_033 I would love it
p232_034 It is marvellous
p232_035 Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night
p232_036 But it may take some time to confirm the findings
p232_037 Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack
p232_038 It was fit for royalty
p232_039 I was scared
p232_040 Dancing was her life
p232_041 I suspect the latter
p232_042 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p232_043 But it took a lot of bottle
p232_044 We will push
p232_045 It is urgent
p232_046 The judge said
p232_047 It is difficult for Ali
p232_048 But it might have done
p232_049 The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids
p232_050 They had to explain it
p232_051 Here's a clue
p232_052 We were surprised to see the photograph
p232_053 It's the big omission
p232_054 Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident
p232_055 It's very odd
p232_056 Because we do not need it
p232_057 It's not pretty, but it's effective
p232_058 This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers
p232_059 That's the truth
p232_060 That is very hard, alone
p232_061 The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine
p232_062 The problems are a result of that shortfall
p232_063 You do not change overnight
p232_064 People love to see this stuff
p232_065 He was popular
p232_066 I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset
p232_067 Charles Kennedy had an effective outing
p232_068 It is like a river running by my home
p232_069 We welcome the decision of Mr Byers
p232_070 There is an element of racism in Scotland
p232_071 Painful, but only because it's true
p232_072 That was the easy election
p232_073 There could be a way back
p232_074 Then followed a bout of flu
p232_075 The price cuts are really exciting
p232_076 I had my suspicions
p232_077 It was chaotic
p232_078 It is a job creation scheme
p232_079 He is now resident in England
p232_080 I've got the shirt
p232_081 Today she has been released
p232_082 What has changed ?
p232_083 That is bound to happen
p232_084 I will miss him
p232_085 It's all going to clear the debt
p232_086 She had kept the news from him
p232_087 No progress has been made
p232_088 Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives
p232_089 Now the system is right behind us
p232_090 Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today
p232_091 It is a lifeline
p232_092 Today I couldn't run on it
p232_093 However, it did not end that way
p232_094 This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit
p232_095 I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party
p232_096 Then came the crunch
p232_097 The oil companies would be asked to contribute
p232_098 I wish I had put on a brighter tie
p232_099 They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs
p232_100 It was mayhem
p232_101 They were outside the circle
p232_102 It was a good performance
p232_103 We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors
p232_104 There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee
p232_105 That is no use
p232_106 It was really enjoyable on Saturday
p232_107 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p232_108 He pleaded for caution
p232_109 He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald
p232_110 I don't have many friends
p232_111 He was jailed for a year
p232_112 You had better believe it
p232_113 It's not fair
p232_114 We have to look at everything before we make any final decision
p232_115 Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee
p232_116 Maybe this battle has been
p232_117 Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants
p232_118 Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor
p232_119 This is the end of a chapter, and this is very sad
p232_120 It is rubbish
p232_121 That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships
p232_122 The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment
p232_123 An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks
p232_124 That's all right then
p232_125 I'm so angry
p232_126 Child abuse is a dreadful thing
p232_127 It has removed a bit of guilt
p232_128 Despite the result, it was still a great moment
p232_129 The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies
p232_130 Offered the gold medal, he declined
p232_131 That first victory made a huge difference to my career
p232_132 I am now unemployed
p232_133 If not, a deal could take many months
p232_134 You've got to be vigilant
p232_135 Our intentions are real
p232_136 They took a risk
p232_137 The goals were good
p232_138 What will happen then ?
p232_139 I am totally devoted to this job
p232_140 He is severe
p232_141 She died at her home
p232_142 I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings
p232_143 They did very well
p232_144 The home side didn't stand a chance
p232_145 We want to see the maximum of change
p232_146 It was deployed in the Gulf War
p232_147 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p232_148 The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday
p232_149 We also enjoyed a lot of support
p232_150 She had gone to the Catholic school
p232_151 It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse
p232_152 It was by the numbers
p232_153 I was in daily contact
p232_154 They were later discharged from hospital
p232_155 This latter point is hugely important
p232_156 It is an attitude of mind
p232_158 They say that vital evidence was not heard in court
p232_159 We have to move forward
p232_160 Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors
p232_161 We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors
p232_162 Tell it like it was ?
p232_163 It is not too late to get on board
p232_164 That must be left to the Parole Board
p232_165 Again, we were lucky
p232_166 Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final
p232_167 Waiting times for these services are too long
p232_168 That will do for me
p232_169 It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate
p232_170 We've made a couple of albums
p232_171 My life has been destroyed
p232_172 They thought they had found a home
p232_173 It became a book by itself
p232_174 I always felt they played for me
p232_175 You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions
p232_176 First and foremost, the game is entirely different
p232_177 Blair's response was weak
p232_178 It's the real thing, for sure
p232_179 However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service
p232_180 The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton
p232_181 The clarity is vital
p232_182 I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal
p232_183 Everyone can be bought
p232_184 A career as a doctor is on hold
p232_185 Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked
p232_186 It is the whole package
p232_187 I've been there
p232_188 Family liaison officers are now working to support the family
p232_189 They receive a high profile in the media
p232_190 We did everything by the book
p232_191 I wish I could say something
p232_192 Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval
p232_193 The procedure is the same in all cases
p232_194 But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections
p232_195 I wanted to put myself on the line
p232_196 I came home by ambulance
p232_197 The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address
p232_198 The conference is the first test
p232_199 The service from the other players was super
p232_200 He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book
p232_201 On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult
p232_202 The sisters also became the top two players in the world
p232_203 A deadline is still essential
p232_204 We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead
p232_205 It's a mixture of everything
p232_206 We're not seeing an image of the person, he said
p232_207 I don't want to use it
p232_208 Now, it's all right
p232_209 There was an e-mail
p232_210 That's the day job
p232_211 Feel the heat ?
p232_212 He knows a lot
p232_213 He is slightly confused
p232_214 She should not be blamed
p232_215 His third goal was superb
p232_216 He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland
p232_217 It's not ideal
p232_218 He seemed to lose his focus
p232_219 He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda
p232_220 The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument
p232_221 Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement
p232_223 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p232_224 That has been the easy part
p232_225 We've got the bronze
p232_226 Mental health is a massive issue
p232_227 At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher
p232_228 It was good fun
p232_229 What was the main difference ?
p232_230 I am immensely sad
p232_231 I'd never seen a play about me
p232_232 It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come
p232_233 The track is currently covered in snow
p232_234 But she was
p232_235 Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable
p232_236 We were awful
p232_237 However, no further action was taken by police
p232_238 And thought we would get away with it
p232_239 It is set in Paris
p232_240 The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days
p232_241 It's quite nice
p232_242 It's quite a line-up!
p232_243 It's a lovely, lovely film
p232_244 The Home Office would not release any further details about the group
p232_245 Broke the birdie record
p232_246 He claimed the government had lost the plot
p232_247 She is well balanced
p232_248 A change in that position would require a decision by the council
p232_249 Jock Brown is appointed as general manager
p232_250 He says that he is no different from any other man
p232_251 Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries
p232_252 We did not compete with any other local farmer
p232_253 I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result
p232_254 Some families have even requested to leave the city
p232_255 It's a record label, not a form of music
p232_256 A friendship that will endure
p232_257 I can't get a job
p232_258 He said he intended to push for a judicial review
p232_259 For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique
p232_260 The bottom line is that we had to get a win
p232_261 One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning
p232_262 It does not appear at this stage that alcohol was a factor
p232_263 However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint
p232_264 The work between the musicians and the fire is very important
p232_265 Blood samples were taken
p232_266 They want to shut the Scottish Office
p232_267 That review will look at management across the sector as a whole
p232_268 Of course, that is not the whole story
p232_269 The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision
p232_270 Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races
p232_271 Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate
p232_272 He is a young man with a new deal
p232_273 He was also married with two children
p232_274 Similar measures are expected in England and Wales
p232_275 Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes
p232_276 Everything will fall into place, it should be fine
p232_277 She has every confidence in his performance of his duties
p232_278 They wanted the club to make money
p232_279 Finally, he paid for the movie
p232_280 Sadly, the revival could not be sustained
p232_281 It's a way of life
p232_282 The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline
p232_283 I am an estate agent
p232_284 The record companies have gone through the floor
p232_285 They were on holiday in Egypt
p232_286 It was a privilege to work for him
p232_287 It happens from time to time
p232_288 He looked very sharp
p232_289 Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that
p232_290 I saw it at a ruck
p232_291 They were also beside themselves
p232_292 The attacker died in the crash
p232_293 The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies
p232_294 A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident
p232_295 Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled
p232_296 He was obviously very genuine
p232_297 These figures are truly awful
p232_298 He should have won
p232_299 He has retired
p232_300 What has altered ?
p232_301 I thought it was my only chance
p232_302 Nothing is safe
p232_303 He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters
p232_305 They are wrong
p232_306 It is a road of death
p232_307 The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand
p232_308 We are in the end game
p232_309 We are now looking at the degrees of injury
p232_310 He was solid
p232_311 Special measures were needed
p232_312 There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh
p232_313 I never thought it would take this long
p232_314 We are a peaceful people
p232_315 Kids are terrible
p232_316 It should be equal
p232_317 Craig is a major concern for us
p232_318 The home team had an amazing start
p232_319 For the moment, our position remains the same
p232_320 Referees are easy targets
p232_321 Davis is very supportive, as a director
p232_322 However, the groups denied the claims
p232_323 I came into this world with nothing
p232_324 We think all other measures are not exhausted
p232_325 Off with their heads
p232_326 It's not long enough
p232_327 My view has now completely changed
p232_328 They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden
p232_329 We agreed to disagree
p232_330 It could have gone either way
p232_331 He was then replaced by Ross
p232_332 Horses are drawn by ballot
p232_333 I'd like to take the plunge
p232_334 Later in the day he was forced to explain his position
p232_335 She did not attend the courtroom
p232_336 It is difficult to get into the team at the moment
p232_337 His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday
p232_338 The team for the first game could be this one
p232_339 They haven't got a hope
p232_340 Who will do it ?
p232_341 Gaelic provision continued to be good
p232_342 That's not eviction because he is not a tenant
p232_343 He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French
p232_344 He has to learn
p232_345 Indeed, it was magical
p232_346 Tiger is the exception
p232_347 Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector
p232_348 That is the very reason why it was so vital
p232_349 I could hardly move for the next couple of days
p232_350 Chambers said he would accept the place
p232_351 Everything was an effort
p232_352 The boat was fantastic
p232_353 Like his acting, it was an accident
p232_354 It is long gone
p232_355 On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos
p232_356 That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog
p232_357 He had played well in that central role
p232_358 It's not that clear-cut
p232_359 She is free
p232_360 It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened
p232_361 I kept going for her
p232_362 You must have a government and a good civil service
p232_363 But the real problem is the closure of the export market
p232_364 It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage
p232_365 However, it was well worth the wait
p232_366 It benefits the whole family
p232_367 He has seen the past
p232_368 It was one in the afternoon
p232_369 To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential
p232_370 We will be homeless
p232_371 The scene is about this ?
p232_372 Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported
p232_373 Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment
p232_374 The group is due to publish its report in the autumn
p232_375 It was a double tragedy for the family
p232_376 He could make it
p232_377 For one veteran, the memories remain vivid
p232_378 The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland
p232_379 They have not done so this season so far
p232_380 I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself
p232_381 Well, the big day has arrived
p232_382 Five members were disciplined
p232_383 Talks are progressing
p232_384 There is no signature
p232_385 I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role
p232_386 That left a bad taste in my mouth
p232_387 It was as if it was all happening at a garden party
p232_388 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p232_389 It has moved on in the last week
p232_390 That's the name of the game, though
p232_391 You thought it was a headache
p232_392 Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare
p232_393 A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting
p232_394 The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia
p232_395 We're looking for justice
p232_396 I can lead by example
p232_397 I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title
p232_398 But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat
p232_399 Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime
p232_400 It will probably take me just days to spend it
p232_401 It is legally binding
p232_402 We knew nothing about it
p232_403 My house was shaking at the time
p232_404 This is a huge confidence boost
p232_405 We have not yet received a letter from the Irish
p232_406 He was a crazy man
p232_407 We should have known
p232_408 Feel the air, the space
p232_409 Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling
p232_410 I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't
p232_411 You wanted the evidence
p232_412 Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra
p232_413 It was that bad, that low
p232_414 I was very young
p232_415 We have just got to keep his feet on the ground
p233_001 Please call Stella
p233_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p233_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p233_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p233_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p233_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p233_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p233_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p233_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p233_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p233_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p233_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p233_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p233_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p233_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p233_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p233_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p233_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p233_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p233_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p233_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p233_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p233_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p233_025 We are a service industry
p233_026 But we will have to wait
p233_027 Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports
p233_028 I am not interested in the money, it is the principle
p233_029 However, the following year the cancer returned
p233_030 On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value
p233_032 Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted
p233_033 This is a central issue
p233_037 However, they continued in their pursuit of victory
p233_038 Victory was never in doubt
p233_039 Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack
p233_040 We are the party of the future
p233_041 I have never been a member of the council
p233_042 He was in his element
p233_043 That means an extra two years
p233_044 At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries
p233_045 All businesses continue to trade
p233_046 The man became a reporter
p233_047 It depends on the decisions of the member states
p233_048 It is all starting to come together
p233_049 Part of the complex is historic
p233_050 The strategy is not without risk
p233_051 But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded
p233_052 I was released after six days
p233_053 Yesterday, he was busy in his office
p233_054 We are working on it
p233_055 I've never been one for complaining about the press
p233_056 This trend is likely to strengthen
p233_057 Still, he did not let himself down this week
p233_058 For the meantime, though, the signs are good
p233_059 There was no safety net
p233_060 He looks as if he could be worth the risk
p233_061 You have to be patient
p233_062 That is all in the past
p233_063 That could be a mistake
p233_064 It was an amazing result
p233_065 Indeed, it is only the beginning
p233_066 He has not been dropped
p233_067 Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London
p233_068 Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued
p233_070 This time, it might be for real
p233_071 She did that for the rest of her life
p233_072 Seriously, we are not concerned at all
p233_073 It starts with the script
p233_074 We were under a bit of pressure
p233_075 The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister
p233_076 We can all make a mistake
p233_077 Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom
p233_079 However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made
p233_080 On the night, it was not enough
p233_081 It is not long term, but I need time to recover
p233_082 However, a ruling will not come before next week
p233_083 They were badly prepared for it
p233_084 It is not a story
p233_085 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p233_086 How are you, sir ?
p233_087 So is that it, then ?
p233_088 Do I have a favourite ?
p233_089 What do we do ?
p233_090 Why do it otherwise ?
p233_091 However, we will obviously keep the matter under review
p233_092 They have a further report to make in March
p233_093 He is in the US
p233_094 The Festival is prepared to help
p233_095 By then, he was walking on water
p233_096 I had a bit in hand
p233_097 We have to have a full statement to Parliament
p233_098 I cannot wait to get started on it
p233_099 That is the fact of the matter
p233_100 It should be a condition of employment
p233_101 I had no intention of misleading anyone
p233_102 It is much as it has been described
p233_103 Police said the family was helping with the search
p233_104 She was there for the start of the campaign
p233_105 He has become a monster
p233_106 In fact, he should never have been in the field
p233_107 Everyone had to play the game
p233_108 In London today, it was business as usual
p233_109 It is not affected by the sale
p233_110 We are currently working on the details
p233_111 According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland
p233_112 I thought it was a fantastic game
p233_113 The picture is the same across Scotland
p233_114 It was the eighties
p233_115 We do not expect any surplus
p233_116 You had better believe it
p233_117 Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw
p233_118 It's not a new concept in jazz
p233_119 My office is bare
p233_120 I'm delighted about that
p233_121 I joined a group
p233_122 They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday
p233_123 Who would be a referee?
p233_125 That's all right then
p233_126 There were no grounds for his action
p233_127 It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside
p233_128 It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged
p233_129 His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years
p233_130 Next season for every manager is a long time away
p233_131 It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation
p233_132 He's been the key to everything
p233_133 It's an amazing landscape!
p233_134 Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family
p233_135 Tenants will be unable to defend themselves
p233_136 The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council
p233_137 I am now unemployed
p233_138 Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland
p233_139 Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll
p233_140 Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general
p233_141 Mr Hall is believed to have broken a leg
p233_142 It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions
p233_143 Is that it ?
p233_144 I saw some terrible things
p233_146 It seems so long since I did the exams
p233_147 We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football
p233_148 Who would be right ?
p233_149 She died at her home
p233_150 He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative
p233_151 That could mean the difference between life and death in action
p233_152 It is like a football team
p233_153 It would be a last resort
p233_154 Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power
p233_155 He will emerge as a world leader
p233_156 It opens the door to the Champions League
p233_157 The home side didn't stand a chance
p233_158 The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday
p233_159 But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company
p233_160 I was so nervous
p233_161 Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe
p233_162 It was deployed in the Gulf War
p233_163 It is not normal practice
p233_164 We also enjoyed a lot of support
p233_165 The attacker has been put in foster care
p233_166 She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers
p233_167 Neither side can win this war
p233_168 Alex has been a huge influence on the club
p233_169 It is so unfair
p233_170 I will tell you
p233_171 Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks
p233_172 They say that vital evidence was not heard in court
p233_173 I have got a wife to feed
p233_174 It's that sort of night
p233_175 Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board
p233_176 Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final
p233_177 The release attracted little attention
p233_178 Waiting times for these services are too long
p233_179 And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers
p233_180 We've made a couple of albums
p233_181 They thought they had found a home
p233_182 He will feel the pain again
p233_183 I always felt they played for me
p233_184 Is Saddam a threat ?
p233_185 I feel like my game has come a long way
p233_186 The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton
p233_187 If that's the case, he will struggle
p233_188 There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging
p233_189 We are very concerned about controller fatigue
p233_190 I was totally wrong
p233_191 There is no point in looking any further
p233_192 I've been there
p233_193 It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area
p233_194 It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait
p233_195 It's a joke
p233_196 I had a train to catch
p233_197 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p233_198 We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner
p233_199 However, this idea is never developed
p233_200 It's very difficult to find a buyer
p233_201 He may need it
p233_203 It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work
p233_204 It wasn't to be
p233_208 It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council
p233_209 I have a cold
p233_210 He had suffered a heart attack
p233_211 A deadline is still essential
p233_212 I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling
p233_213 It was worth a photograph
p233_214 That will be vital
p233_215 We need to handle it
p233_216 The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn
p233_217 I had relied on him
p233_218 His third goal was superb
p233_220 In each case they were a goal down
p233_221 The FBI could become involved
p233_222 Work has started
p233_223 The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers
p233_224 He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda
p233_225 The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo
p233_226 Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E
p233_228 Mental health is a massive issue
p233_229 You have to do your research
p233_230 We played them off the pitch
p233_231 The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions
p233_232 Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval
p233_233 It's a question of creating a future awareness
p233_234 My neighbours are horrified
p233_235 But he failed to win the committee's support
p233_236 I can't wait to meet him
p233_237 Broke the birdie record
p233_238 Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight
p233_239 The role was a knockout, but really difficult
p233_240 The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days
p233_241 A succession of managers in the opera company resigned
p233_242 We were extremely poor
p233_243 I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay
p233_244 Chambers said he would accept the place
p233_245 I know I'm in a very special position
p233_246 We did not compete with any other local farmer
p233_247 The salary changes are long overdue
p233_248 The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery
p233_249 It is a policy which has the full support of the minister
p233_250 There wasn't a goal
p233_251 It was a cry for help
p233_252 A friendship that will endure
p233_253 This year I understood
p233_254 Her presence was almost everywhere
p233_255 For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique
p233_256 The distinction is also supported by doctors
p233_257 I watched a game
p233_258 There will be tough opponents to this report
p233_259 One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning
p233_260 I was happily surprised
p233_261 He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention
p233_262 It is also very valuable
p233_263 I've spent a lot of time on buses
p233_264 This court has made an order which has not been observed
p233_265 It is not just about pay
p233_266 Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention
p233_267 George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks
p233_268 Blood samples were taken
p233_269 They are never here
p233_270 That review will look at management across the sector as a whole
p233_271 It looks as though he will be right
p233_272 We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter
p233_273 Immediate action must be taken
p233_274 He is a young man with a new deal
p233_275 It was an easy decision to come here
p233_276 It is the same in Sweden
p233_277 And Michael was just great
p233_278 It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players
p233_279 Everything will fall into place, it should be fine
p233_280 She has every confidence in his performance of his duties
p233_281 Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry
p233_282 However, he will have his work cut out defending his title
p233_283 I feel pretty good
p233_284 They were on holiday in Egypt
p233_285 It was a privilege to work for him
p233_286 It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday
p233_288 They were too hard
p233_289 He looked very sharp
p233_290 All options are open
p233_291 The attacker died in the crash
p233_292 It was a virus
p233_294 I do not think this family will ever get over this
p233_295 Like his acting, it was an accident
p233_296 Sunday's game was not a trial
p233_297 Who can predict ?
p233_298 This is a huge confidence boost
p233_299 I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission
p233_300 We have to sort it out ourselves
p233_301 That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients
p233_302 I thought it was my only chance
p233_303 One was a lawyer
p233_304 Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday
p233_305 They should be swept away
p233_306 This is a war over our home
p233_307 Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well
p233_308 I was in daily contact
p233_309 We want to play at the worlds
p233_310 This is the culture change in medicine
p233_311 Is there on his hands ?
p233_312 We have got no money to go anywhere
p233_313 The election is total confusion and chaos
p233_314 It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register
p233_315 The problems began a long time ago
p233_316 My body is clearly capable
p233_317 We are very strongly behind the bid
p233_319 But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament
p233_320 My view has now completely changed
p233_321 It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure
p233_322 We agreed to disagree
p233_323 On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research
p233_324 I saw some good things
p233_325 Later in the day he was forced to explain his position
p233_326 Robert is a special talent
p233_327 It added to the spectacle
p233_328 Who was the mystery MP ?
p233_329 He told the court
p233_330 The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk
p233_331 Who will do it ?
p233_332 However, Sharon rejected the claims
p233_333 Gaelic provision continued to be good
p233_334 He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French
p233_335 Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident
p233_336 The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper
p233_337 Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector
p233_338 Nobody else was with me
p233_339 I've learned from my mistakes
p233_340 I could hardly move for the next couple of days
p233_341 The composer will conduct
p233_342 I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil
p233_343 This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required
p233_344 His contract was then not renewed
p233_345 Eight months later, he was dead
p233_346 On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos
p233_347 He had played well in that central role
p233_348 The decision is an absolute disgrace
p233_349 Tyson is overwhelmed
p233_350 However, it was well worth the wait
p233_351 He agreed with my proposal
p233_352 Hartley should know
p233_353 Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment
p233_354 The group is due to publish its report in the autumn
p233_355 It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak
p233_356 Also, it is the season of goodwill
p233_357 Equity declined to comment
p233_358 You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel
p233_359 He could make it
p233_360 The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season
p233_361 They have not done so this season so far
p233_362 This big issue is whether it can be enforced
p233_363 Safety was also an issue
p233_364 They received a reply from their own managers
p233_365 But I managed
p233_366 They play together perfectly
p233_367 In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win
p233_368 Colour was at the core of his life
p233_369 It was as if it was all happening at a garden party
p233_370 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p233_371 We shall not be moved
p233_373 It was a hit
p233_374 He's a nice guy
p233_375 Treatment is not an issue with these people
p233_376 Since then, he has played no active part in the company
p233_377 Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director
p233_378 The mood was defiant
p233_379 Yet the data is compelling
p233_381 It's just outrageous
p233_382 The road was closed for several hours
p233_383 It is unusual
p233_384 That will come after the game on Saturday
p233_385 The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position
p233_386 That set the tone
p233_387 It was a breathtaking moment
p233_388 I was in jail for five years
p233_389 What happened in the summer ?
p233_390 The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today
p233_391 Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt
p233_392 He has not created a Festival resource
p236_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p236_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p236_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p236_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p236_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p236_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p236_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p236_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p236_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p236_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p236_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p236_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p236_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p236_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p236_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p236_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p236_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p236_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p236_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p236_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p236_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p236_025 A shortlist is to be drawn up next month
p236_026 In both cases, I suffered a fiasco
p236_027 Meetings will also remain private
p236_028 Because we do not need it
p236_029 It's going to have a hell of an effect
p236_030 And we have a singer
p236_031 He was jailed for four years
p236_032 He should emerge as the winner
p236_033 This is a central issue
p236_034 He works at the airport
p236_035 It is not for any other purpose
p236_036 If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it
p236_037 It carried a double message
p236_038 That means an extra two years
p236_039 That was the case with David
p236_040 The staff are as good as any staff in the city
p236_041 I needed a change, a new challenge
p236_042 Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man
p236_043 Their campaign is in disarray
p236_044 But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded
p236_045 We are working on it
p236_046 He looks like an Afghan
p236_047 Everything else is a bonus
p236_048 Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts
p236_049 This is the interesting part
p236_050 I haven't been ill at all
p236_051 They just thought it was extremely good acting
p236_052 That was the difference today
p236_053 We keep an eye on it
p236_054 The City welcomed the brighter outlook
p236_055 We felt it was sufficient
p236_056 You must have a government and a good civil service
p236_057 Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued
p236_058 You should consider whether you want to be in this film
p236_059 But retail banking would be run from Halifax
p236_060 I have proved that in the past
p236_061 The tournament has now been cancelled
p236_062 I was very pleased with them today, though
p236_063 I was as strong as a horse
p236_064 Then followed a bout of flu
p236_065 The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister
p236_066 Both men were on one-year contracts
p236_068 Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator
p236_069 It is a job creation scheme
p236_070 He was seen as the enemy
p236_071 It looks like a hit
p236_072 These people are not big names
p236_073 This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst
p236_074 We did it for the jersey
p236_075 The Festival is prepared to help
p236_076 Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat
p236_077 By then, he was walking on water
p236_078 He was just a journalist
p236_079 On Saturday, it was much the same
p236_080 They lived for their children
p236_081 We have turned the corner
p236_083 The Queen Mother is dead
p236_084 However, the approach is not believed to be hostile
p236_085 Change will however have to be in euros
p236_086 It was a big departure
p236_087 Does it matter ?
p236_088 How do you take them away ?
p236_089 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p236_090 After the match, do you ?
p236_091 The oil companies would be asked to contribute
p236_092 The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen
p236_093 It is open season on the Old Firm
p236_094 The court was shown a video of the house on that day
p236_095 I had a ball today
p236_096 He refused to name the survivors
p236_097 That time is not now, however
p236_098 We created so many chances
p236_099 Before the game we went for a pint
p236_100 Our house was very small
p236_101 It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials
p236_102 It became difficult for me
p236_103 It's not a lack of effort
p236_104 It is a total and utter change of culture
p236_105 He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter
p236_107 They will notice a difference
p236_108 Football is a passion for many
p236_109 New Year will be very busy
p236_110 There's still plenty time left
p236_111 The result is a vacuum
p236_112 I've heard this stuff about the markets
p236_113 You can spend money on housing
p236_114 The hearing was due to continue today
p236_115 I can't even get into the A team
p236_116 In addition, investor choice is reduced
p236_117 But his attendance is not guaranteed
p236_118 Three hours later, the man was free
p236_119 Which can happen any time
p236_120 The colours are very pretty
p236_121 He is a lovely man
p236_122 Becoming a father was wonderful
p236_123 I was on a roll
p236_124 The abuse of elderly people was appalling
p236_125 Something will be done by corporate bodies
p236_126 He said to give a local injection
p236_127 They made such decisions in London
p236_128 You are a gambling man
p236_129 Before it was an ordeal
p236_130 I love the spectacle of cinema
p236_131 We will try to find someone
p236_132 They could use a boost
p236_133 She died at her home
p236_134 I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood
p236_135 I enjoy the creative process
p236_136 But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers
p236_137 Five minutes later, the home team were back in front
p236_138 It was a piece of art
p236_139 That view has not altered
p236_140 It's all change at Kilmarnock
p236_141 So I got a blood test
p236_142 It has become a way of life
p236_143 The whole industry is a shambles
p236_144 Like the others, he was arrested
p236_145 We will provide immediate access
p236_146 He could do nothing about it
p236_147 We have a clean bill of health
p236_148 Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment
p236_149 I was shaking on the blocks
p236_151 It was by the numbers
p236_152 It would seem a natural progression
p236_153 This year, this month, will be special for Torrance
p236_154 This action reflects a slump in bookings
p236_155 Being involved at that level is like an addiction
p236_156 It was a funny feeling
p236_157 I'm afraid to say anything
p236_158 We did what we had to do
p236_159 It's not like us
p236_161 It is not a financial issue
p236_162 I have got a wife to feed
p236_163 Seven people were later detained by police
p236_164 The striker needed attention before he could resume
p236_165 We have a budget in March
p236_166 He is not a team captain
p236_167 Greenwood said he was happy with that
p236_168 Overall, the labour market continued to tighten
p236_169 It opens the door to the Champions League
p236_170 That is not the case
p236_172 It's nice to be nice
p236_173 They could not match it
p236_174 Are they free ?
p236_175 What are they for ?
p236_176 Is there a waiting list ?
p236_177 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p236_178 So what happens next ?
p236_179 Had this been common practice ?
p236_180 What do they want us to do ?
p236_181 At that point, the structure of the board was changed
p236_182 One season, they might do well
p236_183 I feel like my game has come a long way
p236_184 The Hibs manager is no fool
p236_185 It is not either national standards or local control
p236_186 City sentiment is in his favour
p236_187 The hotel was now for sale
p236_188 We are the gateway to justice
p236_189 Tomorrow is a new day
p236_190 It makes no influence on the public
p236_191 Each case is treated on merit
p236_192 I have spoken to head office
p236_193 Says the Duke of York
p236_194 I had too much to drink
p236_195 As many as the market will support
p236_196 They need to look after themselves
p236_197 That is a waste of energy
p236_198 The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland
p236_199 It could be argued that the council was pushed to the brink
p236_200 I had a train to catch
p236_201 It shows the strength of the roots
p236_202 However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu
p236_203 This youngster is so exciting!
p236_204 We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome
p236_205 It caused a lot of upset
p236_206 Motorists will buy passes in advance
p236_207 My duty is to win
p236_208 Tony Blair's official spokesman said
p236_209 On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door
p236_210 No details of the talks were given
p236_211 This will be our new beginning
p236_212 They have the cash and the fire power
p236_213 The service from the other players was super
p236_214 The early physical reports were clear
p236_215 Tommy is not a problem
p236_216 The sanctions are about collective punishment
p236_217 John Daly has a burning ambition
p236_218 A deadline is still essential
p236_219 You have caught a serial killer
p236_220 You are a great player
p236_221 I won't make an official complaint
p236_222 It was worth a photograph
p236_223 They are looking at a flotation
p236_224 Which isn't a bad idea
p236_225 There is no quick fix
p236_226 There was a lot of resentment
p236_227 That might help a bit
p236_228 From there, they can go anywhere
p236_229 Death is outside the language
p236_230 I had relied on him
p236_231 The course has helped a lot
p236_232 I'm just a regular person
p236_233 It had all been arranged
p236_234 His third goal was superb
p236_235 Basically, they have to come up with the offer
p236_236 I am considered a teenager
p236_237 Anyway, the job will be part-time
p236_238 This will secure the future of our industry
p236_239 For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon
p236_240 People should make their own decisions
p236_241 They said that they stood by their statement
p236_242 You have to do your research
p236_243 We played them off the pitch
p236_244 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p236_245 Truth is the child of time
p236_246 And they were being paid ?
p236_247 Was everything done to save people ?
p236_249 Do I think about them often ?
p236_250 That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic
p236_251 A small number of new jobs will also be created
p236_252 It's important to get it right
p236_253 Pensions are a long-term investment
p236_254 Those overseas offices were great
p236_255 On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless
p236_256 Half of young people had had contact with the police
p236_257 I was just a kid
p236_258 He was good, but not that good
p236_259 It was quite a new prescription
p236_260 It is very hard for her
p236_261 He also launched a new strategy for the agency
p236_262 It is believed the size of the settlement has not been finalised
p236_263 We lost our composure towards the interval, he said
p236_264 Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars
p236_265 You can feel at home in China
p236_266 Either way, the investor retains the premium
p236_267 The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK
p236_268 Washington is consumed by the crisis
p236_269 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p236_270 But they were never expected to last
p236_271 However, he lasted only five days before going on the run
p236_272 The capital costs are modest
p236_273 I told you I was ill
p236_274 He will go on the bench
p236_275 That could be in place by next year
p236_276 We accept the new rules
p236_277 We run within the law
p236_278 We have the moral high ground
p236_279 He took over our lives
p236_280 It has all been done in secret
p236_281 They must play for each other
p236_282 Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis
p236_283 She always wanted her own way
p236_284 I realised I was lucky to have it
p236_285 They can leave at any time
p236_286 Much of the equipment was new
p236_287 Blair also had a penalty
p236_288 Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate
p236_289 Frankly, we should all have such problems
p236_290 It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment
p236_291 My body is a wreck
p236_292 She failed in her action
p236_293 Stephen will get his first cap
p236_294 The partnership was set up during the summer
p236_295 And that match was played in June
p236_296 I saw it at a ruck
p236_297 What do we want to do that for ?
p236_298 Does the name matter ?
p236_299 how do you get it back ?
p236_300 What are you not good at ?
p236_301 I think, therefore I am ?
p236_302 It's all designed to speed up the service
p236_303 Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished
p236_304 He will address the nation this evening
p236_305 They have shown a great desire and attitude
p236_306 Maloney is an engaging talent
p236_307 The rescue package is public money
p236_308 I was there five months ago
p236_309 I am a retailer by nature
p236_310 His job was not advertised
p236_311 We can work all night
p236_312 It was really very frightening
p236_313 It was an excellent performance
p236_314 The answer is with ourselves
p236_315 And we can do it
p236_316 These figures are truly awful
p236_317 That is the real test
p236_318 They have to be addressed
p236_319 It aims to produce its report before Christmas
p236_320 Cast Away now on general release
p236_321 All winners should be tested
p236_322 I can live with it
p236_323 A lot has been written
p236_324 And he goes with it
p236_325 The law will take its course
p236_326 This is a historic occasion
p236_327 This ruling is a farce
p236_328 After some discussion they did
p236_329 I am not obsessed with sex
p236_330 I didn't have the reply
p236_331 Public opinion was split on the proposal
p236_332 These days will be back
p236_333 You may have a short memory
p236_335 There was no time scale
p236_336 That decision has already been made
p236_337 In his absence, the council adopted the change
p236_338 The game is now open
p236_339 The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office
p236_340 Even the one she loved
p236_341 Finally, he paid for the movie
p236_342 It was almost too much
p236_343 Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side
p236_344 The idea was first mooted a year ago
p236_345 Three years ago he would have been
p236_346 It's a policy which has worked for us
p236_347 We think a lot of Allan McGregor
p236_348 The confidence isn't there now
p236_349 We put our bid in last night
p236_350 A great deal has been achieved
p236_351 He had no previous convictions
p236_352 Alex Ferguson is the same
p236_353 What do we do ?
p236_354 Why do it otherwise ?
p236_355 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p236_356 So, did she meet him ?
p236_357 George Mitchell is trying to close the gap
p236_358 Like his acting, it was an accident
p236_359 Scotland is the home of golf
p236_360 They have broken that promise
p236_361 From our point of view, the player is free to leave
p236_362 It's only a matter of scale
p236_363 We must put a marker down
p236_364 She said they would appeal
p236_365 There is no deal as yet
p236_366 It's as wide as a church in here
p236_367 The work with Alison was a great experience
p236_368 It was like a weekly wage
p236_369 We are a Scottish company
p236_370 They will fight for everything
p236_371 The pair are very much in love
p236_372 We used to keep our business rates
p236_373 Everything is now in place for Manchester
p236_374 It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage
p236_375 Everyone could see the joke
p236_376 All would be under threat
p236_377 I understand the frustration of the fans
p236_378 On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options
p236_379 The seller was not revealed
p236_380 People are on the alert
p236_381 I can confirm that Miss Deacon has received a threatening phone call
p236_382 We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy
p236_383 A review is under way
p236_384 They know it'll be fantastic
p236_385 This big issue is whether it can be enforced
p236_386 Clark is back on top form
p236_387 Motion described it as a unique event
p236_388 It brought in new management
p236_389 My view has now completely changed
p236_390 She is in their hands
p236_391 The following day I used the story
p236_392 However, the players should have a voice in these matters
p236_393 The Cabinet is split over the issue
p236_394 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p236_395 I should think so, too
p236_396 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p236_397 How are you, sir ?
p236_398 So is that it, then ?
p236_399 Do I have a favourite ?
p236_400 It certainly appeared that way
p236_401 I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday
p236_402 We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow
p236_403 I will be able to say in a couple of weeks
p236_404 I remain a buyer of the shares
p236_405 But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong
p236_406 It had been on the cards
p236_407 He seems to be used to the attention
p236_408 The trick is to try it
p236_409 I would love to think that she could win
p236_410 He may have a point
p236_411 The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position
p236_412 He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response
p236_413 He is on the wrong side
p236_414 My husband was born in Zimbabwe
p236_415 I've got my own ideas
p236_416 I never had a childhood
p236_417 Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt
p236_418 I think it's a miracle
p236_419 They were not complacent in any way
p236_420 They did the right thing
p236_421 He will be judged by his actions
p236_422 The fate of the rest is unknown
p236_423 It is an absolute nonsense
p236_424 Young families accounted for a growing share of the trade
p236_425 Sadly, the surface was a nightmare
p236_426 Everything in golf is a balance
p236_427 It is a case of pity for us
p236_428 I believe the gap is nearly there
p236_429 Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey
p236_430 We've got a good management record
p236_431 It was that bad, that low
p236_432 Paris is not only young
p236_433 However, the downturn has forced the overdraft request
p236_434 But you can go beyond that condition
p236_435 But we have built a platform for next season
p236_436 It looked like a war zone
p236_437 He said current trading was strong
p236_438 I chose to make a film
p236_439 I can tell you Labour is fighting to win
p236_440 But by that time, it was too late
p236_441 The damage is all inside
p236_442 Nine days later, he suffered another attack
p236_443 We would have concerns about that
p236_444 I know the worry over Iraq
p236_445 Taxes may need to rise
p236_446 Equally the employee could claim a public interest
p236_447 Phil Mickelson did that last year
p236_448 No options are excluded at all
p236_449 The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton
p236_450 We are going for it
p236_451 Miss Jackson was not present to put her case
p236_452 It is a cause for concern
p236_453 The weather in the area of the crash was severe
p236_454 I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal
p236_455 He deserved a red card
p236_456 They were not even allowed to see them
p236_457 And she is very clear on this
p236_458 And it covers the spectrum
p236_459 Dennis was not so sure
p236_460 The chief constable has retired
p236_461 It will determine whether an offence has occurred
p236_462 It is a crisis, without a doubt
p236_463 Not if you know the person
p236_464 Her body was found about four miles from the car
p236_465 I was all image and no substance
p236_466 The boys are mentally focused
p236_467 It can all be done over the phone
p236_468 The bill would be massive
p236_469 When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson
p236_470 Neither woman has been named
p236_471 He was certainly upbeat about his chances
p236_472 We live by the rule of law
p236_473 They make a selective perception process
p236_474 He was a shooting star
p236_475 I could feel the blood on my face
p236_476 I am a committed European
p236_477 Analysts said the offer was fair
p236_478 These people attack the core of my beliefs
p236_479 Then came the farewell to Europe
p236_480 It is a vicious circle
p236_481 He will be advised by me
p236_482 Winning a medal is a dream
p236_483 We had to add value
p236_484 That is the bottom line
p236_485 It happens on an annual basis
p236_486 However, he emphasised the bank was satisfied with progress
p236_487 We have to go for a win
p236_488 It worked well in Monaco
p236_489 Something has got to change
p236_490 I had it before the final
p236_491 Our fans have been marvellous
p236_492 The BBC was a disgrace
p236_493 I would put my money on Peter Donald
p236_494 It was still there, but right at the end
p236_495 The Prime Minister has been in touch
p236_496 They never gave up hope
p236_497 He had planned to sell it
p236_498 I was ready for this
p236_499 In fact, we were all over the shop
p236_500 A Scotsman has to defend his castle
p236_501 Our idea is to share and lower the cost
p236_502 I stayed away from the defence
p236_503 Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer
p239_001 Please call Stella
p239_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p239_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p239_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p239_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p239_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p239_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p239_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p239_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p239_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p239_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p239_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p239_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p239_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p239_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p239_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p239_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p239_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p239_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p239_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p239_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p239_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p239_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p239_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p239_025 They might have asked, for goodness sake
p239_026 The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale
p239_027 And so was a photograph
p239_028 We are not aware of any British casualties at this stage
p239_029 There isn't the seriousness of other businesses
p239_030 It is about control of our economy
p239_031 There was a rush of water
p239_032 That's all I was trying to do today
p239_033 Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy
p239_034 Drink and petrol prices remain untouched
p239_035 I might well have done so already
p239_036 That can cost him a fortune
p239_037 He works at the airport
p239_038 How do you take them away ?
p239_039 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p239_040 After the match, do you ?
p239_041 Has the conflict started ?
p239_042 Have I really come to this ?
p239_043 This matter has still to come before the European Parliament
p239_044 It carried a double message
p239_045 Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing
p239_046 But not a penny has been paid
p239_047 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p239_048 Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England
p239_049 We must learn to finish
p239_050 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p239_051 New York is my home
p239_052 The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager
p239_053 I remember that day well
p239_054 Mexico City was a wonderful experience
p239_055 He is too weak to move
p239_056 Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell
p239_057 I feel we might now have the foundations to go forward
p239_058 Among them are many criminals
p239_059 That's been the difference between the sides
p239_060 And they removed a Borderer
p239_061 All manner of precaution and protection are taken
p239_062 Perhaps we should do the same
p239_063 Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight
p239_064 They were on holiday in Egypt
p239_065 They desperately want some stability
p239_066 Everything is possible in football
p239_067 Everyone could see the joke
p239_068 I'm pleased with the horse
p239_069 He will need that machine
p239_070 The new clubhouse was packed with people watching the game on TV
p239_071 Then they scored two goals to win
p239_072 In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson
p239_073 Pulled a huge number of viewers
p239_074 The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government
p239_075 Let's not be too despondent
p239_076 The Government does not go far enough
p239_077 He phoned the number in the brochure
p239_078 I haven't got there yet
p239_079 I can understand the frustrations of our fans
p239_080 They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area
p239_081 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p239_082 Labour has replaced the Tories as the party of the family
p239_083 But the organisers refused to worry
p239_084 And it had two seats
p239_085 Indeed, it is only the beginning
p239_086 Or so the theory goes
p239_087 He has really done well
p239_088 So what happens next ?
p239_089 Had this been common practice ?
p239_090 What do they want us to do ?
p239_091 Is it worth it ?
p239_092 Does it matter ?
p239_093 George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision
p239_094 But I had never been in a theatre
p239_095 It was fun, but not a living
p239_096 Kenny Miller might come through
p239_097 Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London
p239_098 The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account
p239_099 We will pay their bills
p239_100 Sales are falling after years of growth
p239_101 It was exactly four months away
p239_102 But they also noted a partial strengthening of survey evidence
p239_103 We have a major concern about enforcement action
p239_104 I am so proud of him
p239_105 This time, it might be for real
p239_106 He will be kept informed
p239_107 There could be a way back
p239_108 He was a lovely man
p239_109 People will have to be patient
p239_110 I can't remember a lot of it
p239_111 Instead, another depression came in
p239_112 Talk of a crisis is absurd
p239_113 We have thought about doing lots of things
p239_114 It is sometimes like that
p239_115 The partners are looking for answers
p239_116 I've had it for the exams
p239_117 Those people must be accountable
p239_118 We feel very comfortable in this international environment
p239_119 The Festival is prepared to help
p239_120 Accordingly, financial restructuring is required
p239_121 The error appeared in a warrant
p239_122 They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life
p239_123 Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed
p239_124 He was just a journalist
p239_125 They lived for their children
p239_126 Their season has been consigned to history
p239_127 Diversions were put in place
p239_128 How independent is that ?
p239_129 What form did that take ?
p239_130 Are they free ?
p239_131 What are they for ?
p239_132 Is there a waiting list ?
p239_133 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p239_134 Maybe he has been away from British football for too long
p239_135 Last weekend was extremely frustrating
p239_136 Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll
p239_137 Gary Parker is a favourite of mine
p239_138 The allegations were still under investigation, he added
p239_139 It is the only practical access for vehicles and men
p239_140 So it was at Easter Road
p239_141 A move to Manchester United would be tremendous
p239_142 Absences should be carefully monitored
p239_143 He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels
p239_144 The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible
p239_145 We just have to adapt
p239_146 He was forced to quit
p239_147 Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us
p239_148 People have been placed in a state of alarm
p239_149 I was given no instructions by no-one
p239_150 The move follows a review of the Singapore
p239_151 Which isn't a bad idea
p239_152 Since then, things have improved
p239_153 That's what happened against Ayr
p239_154 Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly
p239_155 He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by
p239_156 It is a good lifestyle
p239_157 Before the game we went for a pint
p239_158 Our relationship has been very good
p239_159 It was the climax of the thing
p239_160 Nato has left them with no other option
p239_161 Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive
p239_162 I think the referee was good
p239_163 I understand the medical concerns
p239_164 Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National
p239_165 This was a unique election
p239_166 They exist in name alone
p239_167 We have reacted well to each other
p239_168 I can see it now
p239_169 Having guidelines in advance is helpful
p239_170 There's still plenty time left
p239_171 Those three weeks are totally lost
p239_172 This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service
p239_173 She is in good spirits
p239_174 As if that is an achievement
p239_175 Mr Blair should be warned
p239_176 Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month
p239_177 There was a fossil on screen
p239_178 Is it in the right place ?
p239_179 Did he trip ?
p239_180 Does that put pressure on us ?
p239_181 Did it work ?
p239_182 Do you think we are a top nation ?
p239_183 Here, again, they were denied a voice
p239_184 Structural changes were also required
p239_185 His job was not advertised
p239_186 That was just one night
p239_187 This is a frightening development
p239_188 They keep the atmosphere in mind
p239_189 Millions of British jobs depend on Europe
p239_190 Sloppy answers are to be avoided
p239_191 That is an entirely unacceptable position
p239_192 My father died in childbirth
p239_193 In addition, margins have been maintained
p239_194 Such an appointment could go some way to reassure investors
p239_195 The Yugoslav army will still be there
p239_196 Two years of building a business will go up in smoke
p239_197 You've got to be vigilant
p239_198 He said the director had been completely friendly
p239_199 Tiger is not the norm
p239_200 It's been a humbling year
p239_201 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p239_202 Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces
p239_203 It is all to do with the coaching
p239_204 There was a fine line to tread
p239_205 The refund is fully justified
p239_206 My wife and family are the support system
p239_207 We are now working with full-time on future product
p239_208 He has many offers from the English Premiership
p239_209 He is a very talented player
p239_210 Bottling is now the core business
p239_211 I would be surprised if he decided to give up
p239_212 The protest will go ahead as planned
p239_213 People have been wonderful beyond belief
p239_214 The music is therefore profoundly subversive
p239_215 That group reported just before Christmas
p239_216 We had to add value
p239_217 Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes
p239_218 IT S all change at Kilmarnock
p239_219 So I got a blood test
p239_220 Russell did not appeal the committee's decision
p239_221 I was caught out a little bit
p239_222 There's always the next century
p239_223 The business has expanded rapidly, however
p239_224 But it's an enjoyable job
p239_225 Finding suitable replacements would not be easy
p239_226 There's only one team in Ayrshire
p239_227 Initial market reaction was close to euphoric
p239_228 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p239_229 Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow
p239_230 She had gone to the Catholic school
p239_231 Then we will face the Danish champions
p239_232 It would seem a natural progression
p239_233 Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement
p239_234 We will turn the corner
p239_235 Of course, it is a tough assignment
p239_236 My Dad is a hero
p239_237 Jackie is passionate about Scotland
p239_238 Further details are expected later
p239_239 This is absolutely not true
p239_240 They should stop the bombing
p239_241 These days are long gone
p239_242 And they were being paid ?
p239_243 was everything done to save people ?
p239_244 What was the matter for concern ?
p239_245 Do I think about them often ?
p239_246 Not a great deal has changed in the last decade
p239_247 I've learned from my mistakes
p239_248 Adams is surely worth a chance
p239_249 This season has been a mixture of frustration and fulfilment
p239_250 I've come here for the jersey
p239_251 The question is whether private investors should follow their example
p239_252 The strong performance is expected to continue
p239_253 The challenge for the industry is to capture and retain that talent
p239_254 She replied, It could be
p239_255 Allen is strong in every shape and form
p239_256 Her political persuasion is no secret
p239_257 We have a budget in March
p239_258 ADVENTURE is the champagne of life
p239_259 We have expanded too quickly
p239_260 I'd been out with my girlfriend and we were attacked
p239_261 Boats and other equipment would be pooled
p239_262 Stewart Ivory also declined to comment last night
p239_263 Our position remains the same
p239_264 The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups
p239_265 They could not match it
p239_266 He is not a pathetic figure
p239_267 The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls
p239_268 They made such decisions in London
p239_269 This comes down to a problem of arrogance
p239_270 Harrowing is easy, after all
p239_271 Each case is treated on merit
p239_272 A winter of discontent awaits
p239_273 I thought we were fantastic
p239_274 They are determined to make a meaningful contribution
p239_275 It's going to be very closely watched
p239_276 It is fairly specialised and mainly for the export of breeding animals
p239_277 They receive a high profile in the media
p239_278 Our destiny is in our own hands
p239_279 Miller was every bit as happy
p239_280 Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager
p239_281 Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute
p239_282 There is no internal damage
p239_283 We've had great things in the past
p239_284 It could be done by experts and lawyers
p239_285 It has been recorded twice
p239_286 Aberdeen had little to offer
p239_287 However, Dundee deserved to win this game
p239_288 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p239_289 This youngster is so exciting!
p239_290 It was a pre-emptive strike
p239_291 Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope
p239_292 They will probably come back
p239_293 This is a good incentive for both parties to conclude
p239_294 I saw them last week
p239_295 Friday night was a pretty good night
p239_296 This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds
p239_297 You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice
p239_298 We may need to take some very radical measures
p239_299 Everyone can have their opinion
p239_300 The best thing for me was to join the Army
p239_301 Celtic are delaying the question of a new contract
p239_302 Mr McLeod said he believed a solution would be reached
p239_303 The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts
p239_304 That should give me a chance
p239_305 They have played their part
p239_306 This will be our new beginning
p239_307 They have the cash and the fire power
p239_308 Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon
p239_309 The company hopes to repeat the process in France
p239_310 Racism has no place in any sport
p239_311 Celtic were the losers then
p239_312 What do we want to do that for ?
p239_313 Does the name matter ?
p239_314 how do you get it back ?
p239_315 What are you not good at ?
p239_316 I think, therefore I am ?
p239_317 Who was she ?
p239_318 The result is utterly compelling
p239_319 The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday
p239_320 I have been very nervous
p239_321 Confidence among the allies began to slip
p239_322 There were also some interesting questions and answers
p239_323 I won't make an official complaint
p239_324 It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed
p239_325 It wasn't about her singing, though
p239_326 They are looking at a flotation
p239_327 They make a selective perception process
p239_328 Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match
p239_329 He was admitted to hospital
p239_330 Thereafter they were allowed to proceed
p239_331 It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years
p239_332 January is a bad time of year
p239_333 And they haven't taken the foot off the gas
p239_334 Royal Bank declined to comment
p239_335 From there, they can go anywhere
p239_336 Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning
p239_337 Twaddle is a case in point
p239_338 We used to live with dignity in our country
p239_339 My daughter is an adult
p239_340 It will affect their work
p239_341 Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago
p239_342 I am considered a teenager
p239_343 Anyway, the job will be part-time
p239_344 The FBI could become involved
p239_345 Another High Street retailer was not so lucky
p239_346 I just felt that I was broken down
p239_347 And the World Cup has not even begun
p239_348 It comes from reflection or thinking
p239_349 This is the version which appeared in our paper
p239_350 Translation - we got it wrong
p239_351 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p239_352 They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters
p239_353 What happened in that game ?
p239_354 Are you going to win ?
p239_355 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p239_356 So, did she meet him ?
p239_357 So what is the campaign about ?
p239_358 The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Florida in October
p239_359 William Hague delighted his party
p239_360 That moment when the monster is being brought to life
p239_361 We can't give any figures for Edinburgh
p239_362 Walker plans to return indoors
p239_363 The actual increases will be announced next month
p239_364 The statement contained no surprises
p239_365 The scientific debate is dead
p239_366 This would include the GM food industry
p239_367 But the rally was short-lived
p239_368 Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh
p239_369 They are the innocent victims
p239_370 It didn't matter who was in their way
p239_371 He ended up a headmaster
p239_372 That took about two years
p239_373 He is obviously very dangerous
p239_374 That remains the unanswered question
p239_375 This should come as no surprise
p239_376 It was launched in February last year
p239_377 Commitment is released on Liberty
p239_378 I love the spectacle of cinema
p239_379 He did not say that
p239_380 Pensions are a long-term investment
p239_381 We have not been approached
p239_382 Murray Johnstone will replace it
p239_383 North African countries are also seen as potential customers
p239_384 The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high
p239_385 Those overseas offices were great
p239_386 Well, that's just a third district
p239_387 She asked for the appointment with me
p239_388 Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie
p239_389 A new school will be built
p239_390 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p239_391 How are you, sir ?
p239_392 So is that it, then ?
p239_393 Do I have a favourite ?
p239_394 His leader wanted to celebrate
p239_395 Venus rejects the very suggestion
p239_396 This fact is supported by audience research
p239_397 Because of that I didn't enjoy the game
p239_398 We were beaten by the better team
p239_399 Both sides have to step back
p239_400 Analysts were impressed with progress made
p239_401 Everything has its place and purpose
p239_402 I have received no explanation
p239_403 Turnover was highest in telecoms
p239_404 Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country
p239_405 He also launched a new strategy for the agency
p239_406 This game is very evenly balanced
p239_407 Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential
p239_408 It seems a waste of talents
p239_409 Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service
p239_410 We lost our composure towards the interval, he said
p239_411 You can feel at home in China
p239_412 This would discourage investment and job creation
p239_413 We have no information on Iraq
p239_414 It depends on Labour, not on us
p239_415 Autumn is the time of fulfilment
p239_416 You're not getting any goodwill
p239_417 The baby deserves the credit
p239_418 Washington is consumed by the crisis
p239_419 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p239_420 I should think so, too
p239_421 It makes no difference to their friendship
p239_422 It needs to be sorted out by Easter
p239_423 It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused
p239_424 The capital costs are modest
p239_425 Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me
p239_426 It certainly feels that way
p239_427 This idea has been around for four years
p239_428 Or maybe it's the other way around
p239_429 We are facing a health disaster if we do not act
p239_430 We accept the new rules
p239_431 Blair is very positive at European Councils
p239_432 They are interior designers and architects
p239_433 He was released after treatment
p239_434 All the pieces fit together perfectly
p239_435 Five minutes later, the home team were back in front
p239_436 I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me
p239_437 Things are going to change over the next six months
p239_438 Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia
p239_439 The potential for Scottish beef is not limited to carcasses
p239_440 It is also very valuable
p239_441 The stage was set for a showdown
p239_442 This could put pressure on UK inflation
p239_443 They should not feel under threat
p239_444 Any error is severely punished
p239_445 Either group is living in fantasy land
p239_446 That will be a decision for BBC Scotland
p239_447 Hard cash is needed now
p239_448 Her housekeeper discovered the break-in on Thursday morning
p239_449 Blair also had a penalty
p239_450 Frankly, we should all have such problems
p239_451 Either way, it's very funny
p239_452 We didn't want any trouble
p239_453 It seemed a logical expansion
p239_454 Similar measures are expected in England and Wales
p239_455 And Michael was just great
p239_456 Now it has doubled in size
p239_457 It was never a free kick
p239_458 They failed to reach agreement yesterday
p239_459 This is a great opportunity for us
p239_460 Further savings would arise from common procurement and IT systems
p239_461 Inventories are coming under control
p239_462 She failed in her action
p239_463 We will provide immediate access
p239_464 We also acknowledge the grief and pain of their relatives
p239_465 Recent reports suggested it might be sold off
p239_466 Several hundred people attended yesterday
p239_467 Dunfermline manager Jimmy Calderwood was candid
p239_468 The money is within the total allocation
p239_469 The partnership was set up during the summer
p239_470 This does not create any precedent
p239_471 There's nothing I can say
p239_472 We need a visionary producer
p239_473 The response from everyone was wonderful
p239_474 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p239_475 I am sorry, but I forgot
p239_476 Banking stocks were hit hard
p239_477 We did something about it
p239_478 The criminal justice system doesn't deliver
p239_479 Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday
p239_480 Five years later, the deception continued
p239_481 The rescue package is public money
p239_482 The death toll included five children
p239_483 Again the parallel with football can be drawn
p239_484 Sales have been perfectly buoyant
p239_485 I was there five months ago
p239_486 It happened again, and again, and again
p239_487 It could well be military
p239_488 Holland won by five wickets
p239_489 Other casualties were averted by the swift response of the emergency services
p239_490 They cannot operate without a licence from the local authority
p239_491 It's unlikely to be renewed
p239_492 MOVIE stars are public property
p239_493 I first met him last summer
p239_494 The songs are just so good
p239_495 The whole thing was just unreal
p239_496 I can hardly believe it
p239_497 They haven't been thought through
p239_498 Saturday's match was fairly straightforward
p239_499 I am not unduly surprised
p239_500 Iain Duncan Smith is wrong
p239_501 You are a different people
p239_502 McPherson came from United Biscuits
p239_503 The world record is suspicious
p240_001 Please call Stella
p240_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p240_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p240_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p240_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p240_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p240_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p240_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p240_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p240_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p240_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p240_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p240_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p240_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p240_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p240_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p240_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p240_018 Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p240_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p240_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p240_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p240_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p240_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p240_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p240_025 Johnson was pretty low
p240_026 But it failed
p240_027 Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format
p240_028 Is this accurate?
p240_029 I am not interested in the money, it is the principle
p240_030 They should have a major rethink about the event for next year
p240_031 We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent
p240_032 They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday
p240_033 This is the window
p240_034 People love to see this stuff
p240_035 He took me on a tour of the wards
p240_036 It is marvellous
p240_037 Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night
p240_038 It has failed
p240_039 They're just different
p240_040 It's a real threat
p240_041 It was the eighties
p240_042 Indeed, he does
p240_043 President Bush is at war
p240_044 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p240_045 On this showing, they should stick with the lads
p240_046 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p240_047 It is so sad
p240_048 That period was a struggle
p240_049 This represents a tough game for us
p240_050 Who can say?
p240_051 It's a blessing
p240_052 The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome
p240_053 Hopefully, it will be built by next year
p240_054 He is too weak to move
p240_055 Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight
p240_056 He had no enemies
p240_057 I got a great response from the players, as I had expected
p240_058 However the drama was still not at an end
p240_059 For the meantime, though, the signs are good
p240_060 That's the truth
p240_061 The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine
p240_062 I've had six days of rehearsal
p240_063 He will now seek to sell his shares in the club
p240_064 Art is extra
p240_065 Scotland had great assets
p240_066 They are real
p240_067 There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music
p240_068 I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset
p240_069 It should be devolved
p240_070 We welcome the decision of Mr Byers
p240_071 It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards
p240_072 I was just trying to win the golf tournament
p240_073 I was as strong as a horse
p240_074 They do not work for Glasgow City Council
p240_075 The girls are so lucky to be alive
p240_076 She died in hospital two hours later
p240_077 Is there a new way forward?
p240_078 I've got the shirt
p240_079 Today she has been released
p240_080 The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday
p240_081 Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat
p240_082 What has changed?
p240_083 He is in the queue
p240_084 He liked to give the impression of being a hard man
p240_085 Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money
p240_086 Someone who cares
p240_087 Florida is the pivotal state in the nation
p240_088 Lord Levy said he started life with nothing
p240_089 They lived for their children
p240_090 That will come after the game on Saturday
p240_091 Today I couldn't run on it
p240_092 She told The Herald
p240_093 We could not get any possession
p240_094 He is hungry for success and I am the same
p240_095 It seemed a moving and fitting tribute
p240_096 They were outside the circle
p240_097 He said he hoped for a first meeting within a few days
p240_098 It was a good performance
p240_099 I see no need for change
p240_100 We have every respect for Michelle
p240_101 But they did not even get a reply to their letter
p240_102 He takes the job
p240_103 They will want to perform well
p240_104 That all hope is never lost
p240_105 It was really enjoyable on Saturday
p240_106 Getting new people interested in this music is the real reward
p240_107 It's in his blood
p240_108 It's a shame
p240_109 It had been played at festivals
p240_110 I came to complete
p240_111 It's a question of perception
p240_112 In the current outbreak, the reverse is true
p240_113 This film will be totally awesome
p240_114 Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants
p240_115 I'm delighted about that
p240_116 Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear
p240_117 I joined a group
p240_118 This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election
p240_119 She really suffered for her art
p240_120 It is a delight on every level
p240_121 You can spend money on housing
p240_122 There were no grounds for his action
p240_123 It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged
p240_124 Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton
p240_125 I was furious
p240_126 His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years
p240_127 It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation
p240_128 Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family
p240_129 I do not think this family will ever get over this
p240_130 Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't
p240_131 Offered the gold medal, he declined
p240_132 It was the same at Twickenham
p240_133 The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council
p240_134 It is also well received
p240_135 Government will intervene
p240_136 Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg
p240_137 He was in a great deal of pain
p240_138 We want to keep the pound
p240_139 It seems so long since I did the exams
p240_140 And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life
p240_141 Wallace was a prisoner of war
p240_142 Who would be right?
p240_143 She died at her home
p240_144 I am just trying to do my job
p240_145 It opens the door to the Champions League
p240_146 It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment
p240_147 They did very well
p240_148 Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe
p240_149 It was deployed in the Gulf War
p240_150 It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland
p240_151 Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment
p240_152 Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat
p240_153 Mr Blair had done well
p240_154 I was in daily contact
p240_155 My Dad is a hero
p240_156 The weather affected the other two games in Fife
p240_157 Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes
p240_158 Was this element always there?
p240_159 These days are long gone
p240_160 Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks
p240_161 It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened
p240_162 I was in the train station overnight
p240_163 We knew we had the goal we wanted
p240_164 However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands
p240_165 Tell it like it was?
p240_166 We have a budget in March
p240_167 That must be left to the Parole Board
p240_168 By then, however, both men were already in the US
p240_169 They will do their own thing
p240_170 And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers
p240_171 It's quite a routine
p240_172 The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton
p240_173 The hotel was now for sale
p240_174 I drove the ball well
p240_175 Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director
p240_176 They know no other way
p240_177 There is no point in looking any further
p240_178 And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience
p240_179 Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted
p240_180 They will run a mile
p240_181 Neither side would reveal the details of the offer
p240_182 They need to look after themselves
p240_183 Miller was every bit as happy
p240_184 What has caused the demise of singing?
p240_185 We want to help them through it
p240_186 They really did a great job
p240_187 It was an odd affair, in many respects
p240_188 It is tough, but possible
p240_189 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p240_190 Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender
p240_191 The procedure is the same in all cases
p240_192 People will ask about us
p240_193 But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections
p240_194 It is a farce
p240_195 I am totally surprised
p240_196 The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small
p240_197 It wasn't to be
p240_198 There was no option
p240_199 There would appear to be no motive for the attack
p240_200 But we are not immune to the problem
p240_201 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p240_202 Who will pay for this?
p240_203 They've got three-quarters of the way
p240_204 The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster
p240_205 I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling
p240_206 It's all about money, money, money
p240_207 We will give a formal response to the report in due course
p240_208 It's a mixture of everything
p240_209 We have an election in eight days
p240_210 The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow
p240_211 We'll have to work hard today
p240_212 She should not be blamed
p240_213 We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence
p240_214 It had all been arranged
p240_215 A Grampian Police spokesman said
p240_216 His third goal was superb
p240_217 I was so nervous
p240_218 Work has started
p240_219 For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon
p240_220 He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda
p240_221 The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo
p240_222 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p240_223 That has been the easy part
p240_224 Women were mostly notable by their absence
p240_225 But it will be sorted out this week
p240_226 What was the main difference?
p240_227 I am immensely sad
p240_228 It is a gamble
p240_229 At the time, he was a living legend
p240_230 It's so special
p240_231 They are the innocent victims
p240_232 Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable
p240_233 The body follows the mind
p240_234 However, no further action was taken by police
p240_235 And thought we would get away with it
p240_236 Jobs could go
p240_237 It is not the message alone
p240_238 It's quite a line-up!
p240_239 It's very safe
p240_240 But it's a subtle process
p240_241 Of further privacy, he had no need
p240_242 He was good, but not that good
p240_243 We were extremely poor
p240_244 Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order
p240_245 In fact, it is deeply unpleasant
p240_246 It is hard won
p240_247 A change in that position would require a decision by the council
p240_248 Jock Brown is appointed as general manager
p240_249 I am the opposite because I haven't played very much
p240_250 I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday
p240_251 In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify
p240_252 He got the same story
p240_253 It is a policy which has the full support of the minister
p240_254 I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country
p240_255 A friendship that will endure
p240_256 He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen
p240_257 Her presence was almost everywhere
p240_258 For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique
p240_259 That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective
p240_260 Blair is very positive at European Councils
p240_261 One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning
p240_262 So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy
p240_263 I was happily surprised
p240_264 They must play for each other
p240_265 It is also very valuable
p240_266 George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks
p240_267 Blood samples were taken
p240_268 There is no link
p240_269 This is a question of Islam
p240_270 It looks as though he will be right
p240_271 Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate
p240_272 Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public
p240_273 Have a look at our accounts
p240_274 He was also married with two children
p240_275 And Michael was just great
p240_276 Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes
p240_277 Access has been a nightmare
p240_278 It has been achieved by hard work and careful planning
p240_279 It's a way of life
p240_280 The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline
p240_281 A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes
p240_282 However, he will have his work cut out defending his title
p240_283 People have no choice
p240_284 In essence, the teaching profession has a choice
p240_285 In fact, he was talking about the survival business
p240_286 If not, he should go home
p240_288 His mother refuses to believe that she is dead
p240_289 Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that
p240_290 This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter
p240_291 Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished
p240_292 He will address the nation this evening
p240_293 It was a virus
p240_294 Maloney is an engaging talent
p240_295 The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies
p240_296 It's like a high school play
p240_297 Who did the recruiting?
p240_298 He was obviously very genuine
p240_299 She said she could not believe that they had run away
p240_300 Saturday's match was fairly straightforward
p240_301 A new school will be built
p240_302 We have to sort it out ourselves
p240_303 He said she was mad
p240_304 I was the sheep
p240_305 There was no hint of scandal
p240_306 The home was now under new management
p240_307 The whole matter is somewhat in the air
p240_308 We are now looking at the degrees of injury
p240_309 In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge
p240_310 We do not expect any surplus
p240_311 The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn
p240_312 The plot is minimal
p240_313 And he goes with it
p240_314 SCOTLAND has shown the way
p240_315 It is no surprise
p240_316 Let's hope it's an investment in the future
p240_317 The court was shown a video of the house on that day
p240_318 They will certainly be visible from every house in our area
p240_319 They were fantastic
p240_320 There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh
p240_321 We are a peaceful people
p240_322 The election is total confusion and chaos
p240_323 Henman has been warned
p240_324 Craig is a major concern for us
p240_325 It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register
p240_326 It is out there
p240_327 Referees are easy targets
p240_328 They had a confession
p240_329 We do the same
p240_330 That's the law of the land
p240_331 Donald was his friend
p240_332 I am so upset
p240_333 They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden
p240_334 Last night, he pledged to clear his name
p240_335 The police have to act to help them
p240_336 We agreed to disagree
p240_337 It could have gone either way
p240_338 He was then replaced by Ross
p240_339 I saw some good things
p240_340 I've not thought about it
p240_341 Who was the mystery MP?
p240_342 In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times
p240_343 It is a sign of hope
p240_344 Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side
p240_345 Three years ago he would have been
p240_346 Locally, too, the MP is under fire
p240_347 It is so unfair
p240_348 They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance
p240_349 He has to learn
p240_351 Look at the witnesses
p240_352 That is the very reason why it was so vital
p240_353 However, this suggestion was turned down by the player
p240_354 The composer will conduct
p240_355 This is a friendly match?
p240_357 They should take their mobile phones
p240_358 On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos
p240_359 However, we will obviously keep the matter under review
p240_360 He had played well in that central role
p240_361 He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal
p240_362 That is a break with tradition
p240_363 A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company
p240_364 The council said the house would have to be demolished
p240_365 They say that vital evidence was not heard in court
p240_366 In addition, it was in breach of natural justice
p240_367 As, indeed, they would be
p240_368 But the real problem is the closure of the export market
p240_369 Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors
p240_370 Hartley should know
p240_371 That would help
p240_372 A deadline is still essential
p240_373 Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported
p240_374 Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment
p240_375 We are looking for perfection
p240_376 On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options
p240_377 He later became a respected High Court judge
p240_378 It's been hard
p240_379 It's now down in black and white
p240_380 Safety was also an issue
p243_001 Please call Stella
p243_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p243_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p243_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p243_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p243_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p243_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p243_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p243_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p243_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p243_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p243_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p243_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p243_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p243_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p243_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p243_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p243_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p243_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p243_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p243_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p243_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p243_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p243_025 He has the right attitude but the wrong approach
p243_026 His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with
p243_027 I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany
p243_028 The west coast line is not just for middle England
p243_029 The Budget is a boost for Scottish business
p243_030 She brought a lot to my life
p243_031 Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however
p243_032 Thomson and his family left court without comment
p243_033 I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club
p243_034 But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story
p243_035 It is about control of our economy
p243_036 Each brand was owned by a different family
p243_037 That was not perfect golf by any means
p243_038 He added that her comments were noted
p243_039 She will get through it I'm sure
p243_040 Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line
p243_041 Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes
p243_042 He does not even trust his own members
p243_043 He too started on the subs seats
p243_044 Is it worth it ?
p243_045 Does it matter ?
p243_046 How do you take them away ?
p243_047 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p243_048 After the match, do you ?
p243_049 Has the conflict started ?
p243_050 Have I really come to this ?
p243_051 I'm as fit as I can get
p243_052 We took part in a festival called Global Dance
p243_053 He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts
p243_054 The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said
p243_055 Andy was a huge influence yet again
p243_056 They seem too much of a sure thing
p243_057 Her husband had been waiting for her return
p243_058 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p243_059 We just want this season to end
p243_060 It was a day she thought she would never see
p243_061 Talks have continued at many different levels
p243_062 The referee is there to decide these things
p243_063 There were no details of the other five victims
p243_064 It also has a good labour supply
p243_065 Indeed he has a lot of output
p243_066 Do not give your details to anyone
p243_067 He was failed by his health authority
p243_068 But it was not all bad news
p243_069 I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these
p243_070 But during the bid process, that changed completely
p243_071 It turned me against the whole system
p243_072 She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were
p243_073 I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission
p243_074 But two groups refused to sign up
p243_075 I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday
p243_076 It had little effect on European equity markets
p243_077 I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board
p243_078 The key to the whole project will be environmental concern
p243_079 The squad spent the night at police headquarters
p243_080 They said our costs were too high
p243_081 I do not attempt to answer that
p243_082 It's been a great evening for us
p243_083 That kind of growth is the important thing
p243_084 A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre
p243_085 No plan for projects are yet in place
p243_086 Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green
p243_087 I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me
p243_088 Celtic have a great base of travelling fans
p243_089 I feel I did not have enough time
p243_090 Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee
p243_091 I can't remember a lot about the accident
p243_092 Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones
p243_093 They had the appeal of TV stars
p243_094 There is no issue of national security involved here
p243_095 He will be a very hard act to follow
p243_096 Earlier, both main parties had agreed a crucial stage had been reached
p243_097 Put simply, it goes something like this
p243_098 Over one million people have been forced from their homes
p243_099 Even if he doesn't have any lines
p243_100 I am delighted to hear this news
p243_101 We are already seeing some positive results
p243_102 We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning
p243_103 We were under a bit of pressure
p243_104 They won't actually make any money from it
p243_105 I bought a flat six years ago
p243_106 They would now be able to look forward with confidence
p243_107 They are a different team at home
p243_108 It took around three minutes from beginning to end
p243_109 Scotland is never far away at Westminster
p243_110 Some young girls also came by last night
p243_111 Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager
p243_112 What are they for ?
p243_113 Is there a waiting list ?
p243_114 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p243_115 So what happens next ?
p243_116 Had this been common practice ?
p243_117 What do they want us to do ?
p243_118 The idea is the shop within a shop
p243_119 I left five minutes after he had finished his round
p243_120 It is the right package for Scotland
p243_121 They have no real friends in the region
p243_122 England were ahead until two minutes into injury time
p243_123 Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat
p243_125 I think there's not much between them
p243_126 So I am going in the right direction
p243_127 Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult
p243_128 We have to offer value for money
p243_129 It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces
p243_130 I could live without the attention, he admitted
p243_131 He's got to look after himself now
p243_132 He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking
p243_133 No country has a similar training programme
p243_134 There is no future in rock music
p243_135 Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently
p243_136 Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies
p243_137 The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength
p243_138 We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools
p243_139 The programme has been made with great care
p243_140 There was only one living room, you see
p243_141 I am not under any new pressure
p243_142 The allegations were still under investigation, he added
p243_143 It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row
p243_144 They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat
p243_145 All eight victims were based in Germany
p243_146 Look, George W Bush will come here in two months
p243_147 You should feel involved in their lives
p243_148 It is open season on the Old Firm
p243_149 Is it in the right place ?
p243_150 Did he trip ?
p243_151 Does that put pressure on us ?
p243_152 Did it work ?
p243_153 Do you think we are a top nation ?
p243_154 Three senior officials were dismissed last week
p243_155 Time may already have run out for this option
p243_156 No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised
p243_157 When it happened, he could hardly believe it
p243_158 They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes
p243_159 As our national coach, Brown is done for
p243_160 A progress report will be published in October
p243_161 This man could yet win over Scottish hearts
p243_162 That will reduce my chance of selection
p243_163 When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium
p243_164 Surely it can't run for two years
p243_165 But the game is still wide open
p243_166 It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time
p243_167 However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there
p243_168 I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight
p243_169 We had to work very hard for our points
p243_170 That is a big risk at any price
p243_171 You need a long-term strategy in football
p243_172 He said some things which were better left alone
p243_173 If successful, several records will be made
p243_174 The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year
p243_175 It didn't come as any great surprise
p243_176 Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in
p243_177 It's just a different way of life
p243_178 Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe
p243_179 Nato has left them with no other option
p243_180 I am secure in my own position
p243_181 Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park
p243_182 She is believed to be in South Africa
p243_183 The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster
p243_184 We have come a long way since then
p243_185 I made my mind up before we came on tour
p243_186 A great player has to win major championships
p243_187 Highland health board has a responsibility here
p243_188 I didn't miss the big house at all
p243_189 The story was not made public by this club
p243_190 That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies
p243_191 You are not long home from work
p243_192 I am fighting the force of nature
p243_193 It involved everything in terms of behaviour
p243_194 Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere
p243_195 And they were being paid ?
p243_196 was everything done to save people ?
p243_197 What was the matter for concern ?
p243_198 But they had to be paid for
p243_199 There was no way back for Rangers after that blow
p243_200 The police insisted that they were standard issue
p243_201 One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone
p243_202 I've never had a year like this
p243_203 Full details are expected to be released in June
p243_204 As you see with the fuel duty business, they do
p243_205 Hague will be leader at the election after next
p243_206 He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery
p243_207 I want an answer from the British Government
p243_208 Gas production was also at record levels last year
p243_209 They are a victim of their own success
p243_210 We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance
p243_211 This is a young squad and we're all supporters
p243_212 It is going to change the world
p243_213 Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager
p243_214 People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this
p243_215 The study is entirely into the issue of future funding
p243_216 I am not going to judge them
p243_217 I do not see this so much as failure
p243_218 A European final must be the millennium target
p243_219 Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time
p243_220 I was independent but I am not now
p243_221 We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things
p243_222 We are still seeking that complete performance
p243_223 My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high
p243_224 Someone should force President Bush to watch this film
p243_225 The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors
p243_226 If not, a deal could take many months
p243_227 This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses
p243_228 Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals
p243_229 I want to see as much progress as possible
p243_230 This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media
p243_231 I felt we played some excellent football in the first half
p243_232 The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago
p243_233 They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust
p243_234 The labour side has developed in the North area
p243_235 You are not allowed to do that
p243_236 That is the last thing they need
p243_237 He has worked for several years in the United States
p243_238 The children were later able to leave by bus
p243_239 Jim was down there with his wife
p243_240 Was it the wife ?
p243_241 Why change it ?
p243_242 What do we want to do that for ?
p243_243 Does the name matter ?
p243_244 how do you get it back ?
p243_245 What are you not good at ?
p243_246 I think, therefore I am ?
p243_247 Church leaders warned other homes could close
p243_248 The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia
p243_249 My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind
p243_250 He has many offers from the English Premiership
p243_251 However, the figures tell a different story
p243_252 The rise has come too late for some
p243_253 Rangers then had a couple of good efforts
p243_254 I'd rather play well next week than here
p243_255 Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen
p243_256 The British Government should follow the Irish example
p243_257 Commercial producers were present in large numbers
p243_258 Despite his success, things began to fall apart
p243_259 Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials
p243_260 And they never show the same film as a rival
p243_261 Every player goes through this after a serious injury
p243_262 There would be a north and south division
p243_263 The same trend showed up throughout Britain
p243_264 The two companies were not for sale
p243_265 His condition was described as serious last night
p243_266 The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis
p243_267 The board do not own the company
p243_268 Last night Bush carried it rather easily
p243_269 They always want to give a performance
p243_270 Its primary business channel is the internet
p243_271 That's been the difference between the sides
p243_272 The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned
p243_273 I think I was about four years old
p243_274 Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday
p243_275 It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan
p243_276 Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that
p243_277 I think the shares are good value
p243_278 One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas
p243_279 Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas
p243_280 The life office will now stay with Abbey
p243_281 Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan
p243_282 Overall, the last hole was good to the women
p243_283 He may be ready for first team action in March
p243_284 The fans pay for their season tickets
p243_286 In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council
p243_287 Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction
p243_288 No-one had seen this sort of thing before
p243_289 We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost
p243_290 He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is
p243_291 He would get into any world team
p243_292 Its work includes dealing with child abuse
p243_293 They first met during a Step in London
p243_294 The agreement remains the only show in town
p243_295 The question is whether private investors should follow their example
p243_296 The strong performance is expected to continue
p243_297 Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors
p243_298 It is based on population rather than need
p243_299 He could understand both points of view
p243_300 So, did she meet him ?
p243_301 So what is the campaign about ?
p243_302 And does it ?
p243_303 Are you from the rugby ?
p243_304 Had I heard ?
p243_305 What happened in that game ?
p243_306 Are you going to win ?
p243_308 Further heavy charges are expected this year
p243_309 It happened on average once a week this year
p243_310 This is the version which appeared in our paper
p243_311 He is keen to stay in public service
p243_312 Of course people will try the things they see on TV
p243_313 For that reason cover should not be given
p243_314 He felt too close to head office
p243_315 If you believe in the blue and white
p243_316 A report on their property is due within days
p243_317 He will just go on doing his job
p243_318 I always felt they played for me
p243_319 That's the danger when you have to play too many young players
p243_320 The team spirit that was here last year is again good
p243_321 This term they are second bottom with three games left to play
p243_322 We will not simply hit these people
p243_323 We still think this trade is on the increase
p243_324 It is not either national standards or local control
p243_325 His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland
p243_326 I feel as if I can hole everything now
p243_327 I try to be open to experience
p243_328 He is not exactly a pretty child
p243_329 I thought the race was a little bit slow
p243_330 If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty
p243_331 Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that
p243_332 I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career
p243_333 These options include the possible merger or sale of the company
p243_334 One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday
p243_335 Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action
p243_336 I hope numbers will be up on last time
p243_337 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p243_338 How are you, sir ?
p243_339 So is that it, then ?
p243_340 Do I have a favourite ?
p243_341 Put another way, they just won't do it
p243_342 Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says
p243_343 Getting that balance right can be very difficult
p243_344 Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right
p243_345 Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident
p243_346 It was a bit like having children
p243_347 And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive
p243_348 And that is the bottom line - box office
p243_349 I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days
p243_350 I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us
p243_352 Sales will begin by the end of October
p243_353 The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change
p243_354 Friday night was a pretty good night
p243_355 It is not a material issue for a group with our strength
p243_356 The deal is expected to be completed by September
p243_357 It is the only natural British site on the list
p243_358 His style was direct and very human
p243_359 Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done
p243_360 They have the cash and the fire power
p243_361 The institute board will take the decision
p243_362 He's young enough and he must learn
p243_363 Such a policy is for long-term strength
p243_364 Both players gave so much to the side
p243_365 Stephen has never considered the question of compensation
p243_366 The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday
p243_367 The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named
p243_368 It was a goal which came from nothing
p243_369 We have a substantial value of assets on the ground
p243_370 I have come here to show support for the families
p243_371 We have been going for three years
p243_372 He really played us into a corner
p243_373 They know the truth, they really know the truth
p243_374 It was another black day for Ayrshire
p243_375 Otherwise, we might as well hold it now
p243_376 It used to be all hard sell
p243_377 The direct effects on trade will be limited
p243_378 He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money
p243_379 He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland
p243_380 This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves
p243_381 This is not a small amount of money
p243_382 The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week
p243_383 I just felt that I was broken down
p243_384 What do we do ?
p243_385 Why do it otherwise ?
p243_386 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p243_387 The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission
p243_388 Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions
p243_389 He remains a main board director of Royal
p243_390 His record on Government has always been highly effective
p243_391 My tax affairs have been totally open
p243_392 Five years ago its return was rejected
p243_393 But soon the game dropped back into its old ways
p243_394 In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress
p243_395 In that situation, they thought we should be beaten
p243_396 We are keen to see truth and justice
p243_397 The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn
p243_398 People have a wish to charge twice
p244_001 Please call Stella
p244_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p244_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p244_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p244_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p244_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p244_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p244_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p244_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p244_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p244_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p244_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p244_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p244_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p244_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p244_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p244_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p244_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p244_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p244_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p244_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p244_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p244_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p244_025 We are a service industry
p244_026 It may be good for the soul
p244_027 We want to lift the cup for the fans
p244_028 I am not interested in the money, it is the principle
p244_029 It is about investing in the future
p244_030 However, the following year the cancer returned
p244_031 They were in good humour, too
p244_032 The end result is the same
p244_033 It is on the internet
p244_034 These awards will deliver improvements on the ground
p244_035 IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does
p244_036 This is a central issue
p244_037 History is in the making
p244_038 Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy
p244_039 She was there for the start of the campaign
p244_040 She was at the top
p244_041 In London today, it was business as usual
p244_042 And they had a case
p244_043 Something has to be put in place
p244_044 If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it
p244_045 They are going after them
p244_046 It is all about the story
p244_047 The whole thing is the music
p244_048 In fact, they are the future of investment
p244_049 That is still the case
p244_050 At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries
p244_051 In my view, it has to be done
p244_052 The pressure on the players will build
p244_053 Their campaign is in disarray
p244_054 But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded
p244_055 Yesterday, he was busy in his office
p244_056 It has been a horrible, horrible time
p244_057 Clearly, they had other problems
p244_058 This trend is likely to strengthen
p244_059 For the meantime, though, the signs are good
p244_060 We have got to deliver
p244_061 That was the difference today
p244_062 The company continues to grow
p244_063 He said it was for sale
p244_064 We felt it was sufficient
p244_065 That is all in the past
p244_066 There is a lot to be done
p244_067 But that's another story for another day
p244_068 He has not been dropped
p244_069 It was an outstanding performance
p244_070 I can't remember a lot about the accident
p244_071 Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued
p244_072 It is only the beginning
p244_073 Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise
p244_074 Only water is currently allowed
p244_075 This time, it might be for real
p244_076 She did that for the rest of her life
p244_077 Seriously, we are not concerned at all
p244_078 That will be the office
p244_079 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p244_080 How are you, sir ?
p244_081 So is that it, then ?
p244_082 Do I have a favourite ?
p244_083 What do we do ?
p244_084 Why do it otherwise ?
p244_085 It starts with the script
p244_086 Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision
p244_087 It would have been around the turn of the century
p244_088 I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier
p244_089 Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help
p244_090 It seems a good thing to try
p244_091 However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made
p244_092 It sounds a lot of money
p244_093 However, a ruling will not come before next week
p244_094 It is not a story
p244_095 However, we will obviously keep the matter under review
p244_096 He is in the US
p244_097 I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February
p244_098 It took an option on the process
p244_099 By then, he was walking on water
p244_100 This is a game of confidence
p244_101 On Saturday, it was much the same
p244_102 He liked the weather, the courses, the food
p244_103 The door is still open, but we need a bit of help
p244_104 The trick is to try it
p244_105 I had no intention of misleading anyone
p244_106 Victory was never in doubt
p244_107 This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit
p244_108 On this occasion, the case for a public inquiry was not made
p244_109 Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack
p244_110 Then again, we could have
p244_111 There, you were just a body
p244_112 But he has not become a monster
p244_113 He is not a dancer
p244_114 We had planned to sell the property for some time
p244_115 A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury
p244_116 In the end we have to take a stand
p244_117 This is a sea change in approach
p244_118 Otherwise, the market may come back
p244_119 The procedures were not in place
p244_120 For these people, the ruling is very welcome
p244_121 In the end, we did not spend a penny on him
p244_122 He was not alone at the top of the board
p244_123 The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time
p244_124 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p244_125 We had a great time
p244_126 I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side
p244_127 According to criteria, he is qualified for Scotland
p244_128 It was far from business as usual
p244_129 He wanted to record the group
p244_130 He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter
p244_131 Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals
p244_132 It is hard to believe
p244_133 Or it would have been
p244_134 Three days later, he was killed
p244_135 Football is a passion for many
p244_136 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p244_137 So, did she meet him ?
p244_138 So what is the campaign about ?
p244_139 And does it ?
p244_140 Are you from the rugby ?
p244_141 However, the bank denied that he was in the running
p244_142 That was the first step
p244_143 However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result
p244_144 I have been in contact with him
p244_145 Actors like to be in the centre
p244_146 When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather
p244_147 They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed
p244_148 I am the manager of Scotland
p244_149 There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end
p244_150 There were no grounds for his action
p244_151 I can't even get into the A team
p244_152 It starts at the top
p244_153 Others are expected to follow the lead
p244_154 She does not want to speak
p244_155 It was all for good reason as well
p244_156 One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas
p244_157 It is the latter which has prompted the warning
p244_158 As for the warning, it was not needed
p244_159 If not, a deal could take many months
p244_160 We want to get there
p244_161 On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door
p244_162 There is a lack of staff
p244_163 Not that the occasion was without restraint
p244_164 Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray
p244_165 This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely
p244_166 At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived
p244_167 Full consent is expected by the end of next year
p244_168 Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition
p244_169 Anyone can do the sums
p244_170 We have to create it in the playing strength of the team
p244_171 It is not about the money, it is about everything
p244_172 Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks
p244_173 We were all over the place in the first half
p244_174 Like the others, he was arrested
p244_175 All the pressure was on him
p244_176 Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment
p244_177 They have not been named
p244_178 It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident
p244_179 I think the Labour party is completely split on this
p244_180 It is ambitious, but it can be achieved
p244_181 I was always in control
p244_182 It was by the numbers
p244_183 I would like to see the figures for the second quarter
p244_184 It should never have happened
p244_185 Inside, the atmosphere was quiet
p244_186 The feeling is hard to describe
p244_187 It is difficult to say
p244_188 That is a question for the next manager
p244_189 By then, however, both men were already in the US
p244_190 However, he urged the trade to keep the faith
p244_191 It is simply not true
p244_192 Are you going to win ?
p244_193 Was it the wife ?
p244_194 Why change it ?
p244_195 What do we want to do that for ?
p244_196 Does the name matter ?
p244_197 That you can do it
p244_198 I would like to continue to develop
p244_199 First and foremost, the game is entirely different
p244_200 He has defended the system
p244_201 We want to begin a programme in the UK
p244_203 At the top level, the salaries are far too high
p244_204 It is not an issue
p244_205 They have to get that sorted
p244_206 We can take the city
p244_207 He played it like a veteran
p244_208 It was the story of the second half
p244_209 Many referees are on a hiding to nothing
p244_210 As many as the market will support
p244_211 He is believed to live in Britain
p244_212 Hopefully, it will bring new customers
p244_213 The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland
p244_214 This conference was never confirmed
p244_215 A team is a team
p244_216 However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu
p244_217 I'm interested in interesting work
p244_218 It decided to blame the media
p244_219 THE force is with them
p244_220 This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds
p244_221 It was important to win today
p244_222 He was not injured in the attack
p244_223 Because he was born in England
p244_224 Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon
p244_225 Milk producers were in need of immediate assistance, he said
p244_226 I was not overly concerned about this
p244_227 However, it is not as simple as this
p244_228 We want this place to work
p244_229 It still has an effect
p244_230 The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office
p244_231 I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling
p244_232 Other villages were completely deserted
p244_233 There is a lot of concern
p244_234 It will be decided in the next month
p244_235 We have to win the group
p244_236 It seemed a moving and fitting tribute
p244_237 We're not seeing an image of the person, he said
p244_238 We have an election in eight days
p244_239 There was a lot of resentment
p244_240 This is a fight to the death
p244_241 All will be revealed in due course
p244_242 He is a man of the people
p244_243 The matter is under appeal
p244_244 And they were being paid ?
p244_245 was everything done to save people ?
p244_246 What was the matter for concern ?
p244_247 Do I think about them often ?
p244_248 Is it in the right place ?
p244_249 Did he trip ?
p244_250 Sadly, it could not be done
p244_251 I wouldn't even respond to that question
p244_252 Investors were also concerned about margin pressure
p244_253 Instead, he missed the lot
p244_254 I was never in danger
p244_255 A lot has been written
p244_256 In this case, the farmer had actually given permission
p244_257 It was really good in the first week
p244_258 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p244_259 However, the ball refused to sit for the Frenchman
p244_260 That is not the case in Europe
p244_261 But it was a loss
p244_262 So far, the problems have occurred in the US
p244_263 The performance continues to improve
p244_264 It expected this trend to continue
p244_265 However, no further action was taken by police
p244_266 It depends on Labour, not on us
p244_267 But we were in control at that point
p244_268 It has to be enforced
p244_269 The party has never fully recovered
p244_270 Moreover, it must be for all sports
p244_271 But the government has so far failed to listen
p244_272 He must have a crack at it
p244_273 I am still waiting for a reply
p244_274 Sadly, it sounds as if it is
p244_275 He was good, but not that good
p244_276 The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said
p244_277 Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise
p244_278 However, the matter is not going to end there
p244_279 It might be sad, but it's a fact
p244_280 In fact, it is deeply unpleasant
p244_281 Obviously, we would want to look at this
p244_282 On a practical level, it would be difficult
p244_283 If so, it is a funny time to introduce it
p244_284 It is important that he is involved
p244_285 If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help
p244_286 It should be noted that he has been released without charge
p244_287 In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win
p244_288 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p244_290 I should think so, too
p244_291 None of the agencies was able to help
p244_292 I didn't see the point
p244_293 This idea has been around for four years
p244_294 We are in a war
p244_295 Do you think we are a top nation ?
p244_296 Is our children learning ?
p244_297 How independent is that ?
p244_298 What form did that take ?
p244_299 Are they free ?
p244_300 Scotland won by six wickets
p244_301 However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely
p244_302 This is a historic agreement
p244_303 We have to be realistic
p244_304 Every one is a winner
p244_305 There was a hole in it
p244_306 It will be done in stages
p244_307 It all started with a visiting rugby club
p244_308 Every character was completely different
p244_309 But it is a similar problem
p244_310 In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning
p244_311 But it is important for a number of reasons
p244_312 In that moment, I was happy
p244_313 All of the management has invested in the firm
p244_314 It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence
p244_315 They were not at the property yesterday
p244_316 It involved the same people
p244_317 We want to get back into the Champions League
p244_318 We have to be very, very careful
p244_319 Look at the potential of this club
p244_320 Hopefully, this week will be good
p244_321 This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter
p244_322 We did something about it
p244_323 But it is up again
p244_324 However, the devil is in the detail
p244_325 For the moment, however, the position is clear
p244_326 The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted
p244_327 He is already in place
p244_328 Another difference is the cost
p244_329 Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence
p244_330 And we can do it
p244_331 What are they for ?
p244_333 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p244_334 Tax is a matter for national governments
p244_335 And it's a goodbye from him
p244_336 It is a sensitive issue
p244_337 They have to be addressed
p244_338 This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal
p244_339 Like many companies, it is a problem
p244_340 The business is mainly active in Europe, the US and Australia
p244_341 However, a bid was never made
p244_342 That is the lesson of the last three weeks
p244_343 Something is going to have to give
p244_344 And the context is also completely different
p244_345 The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn
p244_346 The banking sector was weak
p244_347 But the New Year was special
p244_348 We never played at all
p244_349 However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart
p244_350 This isn't the end of story
p244_351 He is a great prospect
p244_352 He has been told by the doctor to rest
p244_353 However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals
p244_354 Of course, it does not have to be this way
p244_355 This latter suggestion is very important
p244_356 However, it does not tell the full story
p244_357 They were impressive against France
p244_358 The challenge is to win a cup
p244_359 Hopefully, he will get a lucky break
p244_360 It was a test in itself
p244_361 Either team will be hard
p244_362 The parents will have a great time, too
p244_363 At first, the youngster was not keen
p244_364 However, it has to be seen as part of a package
p244_365 On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research
p244_366 In fact, it was almost as if it was expected
p244_367 Lately, that market has come under pressure
p244_368 In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times
p244_369 However, it was well worth the wait
p244_370 The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk
p244_371 I have a good feeling about this
p244_372 The news is not all bad
p244_373 Some of the passing was a disgrace
p244_374 However, it does not seem to be the case
p244_375 It is almost certain to be the last
p244_376 You have to be patient
p244_377 However, the appeal judges rejected the argument
p244_378 I was delighted to accept
p244_379 A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry
p244_380 We are not going to fight in Kosovo
p244_381 Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance
p244_382 It's fantastic to win again
p244_383 For businesses, the benefits will be enormous
p244_384 The company won the first round but lost on appeal
p244_385 Everything is in the mix
p244_386 An announcement is expected this week
p244_387 He will be difficult to replace
p244_388 I would be interested in another attempt
p244_389 In addition, it was in breach of natural justice
p244_390 He was on a mission
p244_391 Does it matter ?
p244_392 How do you take them away ?
p244_393 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p244_394 After the match, do you ?
p244_395 One-third of the places are already taken
p244_396 I understand the frustration of the fans
p244_397 Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported
p244_398 On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options
p244_399 I want this one to be different
p244_400 It is the last meeting of the season
p244_401 Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat
p244_402 We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy
p244_403 He is a quality player
p244_404 The service is expected to be introduced in December
p244_405 It's all been about the basics of the business
p244_406 There is a demand for it
p244_407 It's great that it happened in Britain
p244_408 I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role
p244_409 They are not going the length of the pitch
p244_410 Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter
p244_411 However, the players should have a voice in these matters
p244_412 Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents
p244_413 Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side
p244_414 In order to get there, we have got to invest
p244_415 Overall, the labour market continued to tighten
p244_416 There is no need to panic
p244_417 It had been on the cards
p244_418 However, he said the proposal was at an early stage
p244_419 Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare
p244_420 That might mean another delay
p244_421 One day, he threw the baby against a wall
p244_422 I am delighted for them
p244_423 He's had to suffer for the last six years
p244_424 But it was a struggle
p250_001 Please call Stella
p250_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p250_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p250_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p250_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p250_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p250_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p250_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p250_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p250_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p250_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p250_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p250_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p250_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p250_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p250_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p250_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p250_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p250_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p250_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p250_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p250_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p250_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p250_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p250_025 A shortlist is to be drawn up next month
p250_026 Meetings will also remain private
p250_027 I am pretty careful with money
p250_028 Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted
p250_030 This is a central issue
p250_031 We will not tolerate it
p250_032 Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy
p250_033 He works at the airport
p250_034 Smoking is also very important
p250_035 Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism
p250_036 It was just appalling luck
p250_037 Rugby has an extended run
p250_038 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p250_039 Costs have got to be controlled
p250_040 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p250_042 No meaningful response was issued
p250_043 This represents a tough game for us
p250_044 I made a terrible start
p250_045 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p250_046 How are you, sir ?
p250_047 So is that it, then ?
p250_048 Do I have a favourite ?
p250_049 It comes from reflection or thinking
p250_050 Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight
p250_051 Strikers like to go to the ground
p250_052 Planting is unlikely to start before next spring
p250_053 Pulled a huge number of viewers
p250_054 I had trouble with the producers
p250_055 The teacher would have approved
p250_056 The City welcomed the brighter outlook
p250_057 I expect a rapid response
p250_058 She said she was really sorry
p250_059 The problems are a result of that shortfall
p250_060 There's still plenty time left
p250_061 Let's hope that it does
p250_062 We have to keep our clients
p250_063 The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow
p250_064 Companies are now seeking to recover their losses
p250_065 This is the first step
p250_066 We will pay their bills
p250_067 We are talking about the outskirts of London
p250_068 The Farmer wants a new campaign
p250_069 Only water is currently allowed
p250_070 I am about protecting the state pension
p250_071 He later became a respected High Court judge
p250_072 Robin Williams is very subdued
p250_073 It wasn't possible to relax
p250_074 We need to increase the membership
p250_075 There's nothing they can get on me
p250_076 I was as strong as a horse
p250_077 He was a lovely man
p250_078 Both sides have been hit by injury
p250_079 We had a court hearing in London yesterday
p250_080 After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction
p250_081 It makes for an interesting conference
p250_082 I've had it for the exams
p250_083 This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst
p250_084 The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office
p250_085 They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life
p250_086 He put some colour into Scottish history
p250_087 They lived for their children
p250_088 Potions said he would drive
p250_089 I think the industry needs a big idea to rebuild confidence
p250_090 William Hague, the guest of honour, was delighted
p250_091 We are progressing with a few interested parties
p250_092 That view is held by many others within the industry
p250_093 The excitement could hardly be contained
p250_094 The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation
p250_095 It is high time to act
p250_096 Why do it otherwise ?
p250_097 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p250_098 So, did she meet him ?
p250_099 So what is the campaign about ?
p250_100 And does it ?
p250_101 Are you from the rugby ?
p250_102 Had I heard ?
p250_103 It is an old family habit
p250_104 The allegations were still under investigation, he added
p250_105 He was released after treatment
p250_106 We have made no final decisions
p250_107 The outsourcing deal will take effect in September
p250_108 We knew they could do it
p250_109 The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen
p250_110 They must be on commission
p250_111 He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels
p250_113 Mr Wilson has received no such request
p250_114 Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights
p250_115 It's good to have a voice
p250_116 He was prepared for this
p250_117 However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full
p250_118 The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened
p250_119 No, the equipment is extra
p250_120 It didn't come as any great surprise
p250_121 Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain
p250_123 It has been a nightmare of frustration
p250_124 Before the game we went for a pint
p250_125 I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling
p250_126 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p250_127 I understand the medical concerns
p250_128 That's not an assumption that I had made
p250_129 I have learned from him
p250_130 The situation is not easy, but we will prevail
p250_131 He thought she was amazing
p250_132 Figures are not relevant to the strategy
p250_133 This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service
p250_134 It isn't a happy memory
p250_135 We have a team to reach the final
p250_136 Failure is not an option
p250_137 She's got to say something
p250_138 He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery
p250_139 This is a frightening development
p250_140 It is the latter which has prompted the warning
p250_141 That first victory made a huge difference to my career
p250_142 That is far too high
p250_143 My life has changed a lot
p250_144 We did what we had to do
p250_146 You've got to be vigilant
p250_147 You are a gambling man
p250_148 I had decided to quit the show
p250_149 Losing in that manner is very hard to take
p250_150 It was finally agreed on Saturday
p250_151 I love the spectacle of cinema
p250_152 We will try to find someone
p250_153 She died at her home
p250_154 What happened in that game ?
p250_155 Are you going to win ?
p250_156 Was it the wife ?
p250_157 Why change it ?
p250_158 What do we want to do that for ?
p250_159 Frankly, it was worth the booking
p250_160 He was pleased with his display
p250_161 Life is still very tough for them
p250_162 It is not just about pay
p250_163 It opens the door to the Champions League
p250_164 Anyway, the job will be part-time
p250_165 It has become a way of life
p250_166 The whole industry is a shambles
p250_167 People were actually not on his side
p250_168 The defender made an impressive debut
p250_169 There's only one team in Ayrshire
p250_170 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p250_171 They have not been named
p250_172 The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms
p250_173 Yesterday Abbey National said it had injected further capital into Scottish Provident
p250_174 The abuse of elderly people was appalling
p250_175 He was asked to quit
p250_176 This action reflects a slump in bookings
p250_177 Being involved at that level is like an addiction
p250_178 I'd love to be like Peter
p250_179 You will be very welcome
p250_180 It had so much to do with output
p250_181 That would open the gates of hell
p250_182 Further growth will be funded from cash flow
p250_183 The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups
p250_184 They could not match it
p250_185 First and foremost, the game is entirely different
p250_186 But the petrol station does not get the benefit
p250_187 This championship is different from the other majors
p250_188 I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal
p250_189 It appears that it was just a genuine mistake
p250_190 The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions
p250_191 Our fans have been marvellous
p250_192 This could be an amazing attraction for Glasgow
p250_193 They need to look after themselves
p250_194 Miller was every bit as happy
p250_195 They were seriously after him
p250_196 It was a bit like having children
p250_197 Aberdeen had little to offer
p250_198 We represent a wide range of society
p250_199 He was rejected because he had retired
p250_200 We always felt we could win
p250_201 It may have been a cry for help
p250_202 This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds
p250_204 We are going through difficult times
p250_205 We've had an enjoyable adventure
p250_206 For the meantime, though, the signs are good
p250_207 You could feel the heat
p250_208 We have to be happy with a British and European record
p250_209 It was a moment of madness
p250_210 And we have the experience
p250_211 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p250_212 It gave no further details
p250_214 I won't make an official complaint
p250_215 British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US
p250_216 It was worth a photograph
p250_217 The move follows a review of the Singapore
p250_218 It carried a double message
p250_219 Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match
p250_220 This gives a financial incentive to switch
p250_221 That might help a bit
p250_222 Does the name matter ?
p250_223 how do you get it back ?
p250_224 What are you not good at ?
p250_225 I think, therefore I am ?
p250_226 Who was she ?
p250_227 Harry Potter has lost his magic
p250_228 Today we must not repeat that mistake
p250_229 It had all been arranged
p250_230 My daughter is an adult
p250_231 His third goal was superb
p250_232 It will affect their work
p250_233 Basically, they have to come up with the offer
p250_234 I am considered a teenager
p250_235 The process will start tomorrow
p250_236 It's just a normal life
p250_237 The transaction is not feasible
p250_238 I wouldn't even respond to that question
p250_239 It is good for our team
p250_240 Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement
p250_241 That you can do it
p250_242 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p250_243 A career as a doctor is on hold
p250_244 During the communist time they were very privileged
p250_245 They all made the European Ryder Cup team
p250_246 His background is firmly in venture capital
p250_247 The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions
p250_248 I have spoken to the skipper
p250_249 A small number of new jobs will also be created
p250_250 She will attend in July
p250_251 They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house
p250_252 The most important thing is the game
p250_253 There is no timetable for completing such inquiries
p250_254 Paterson can afford to be generous
p250_255 The right decision has been made
p250_257 Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families
p250_258 Customers would then be consulted over any changes
p250_260 Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter
p250_261 He was good, but not that good
p250_262 At half-time he was presented to both teams
p250_263 He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that
p250_264 He is a reporter for us
p250_265 We lost our composure towards the interval, he said
p250_266 Either way, the investor retains the premium
p250_267 We've had several problems over injuries
p250_268 That was a disgraceful performance
p250_269 Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed
p250_270 It was a kind of contempt
p250_271 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p250_272 I should think so, too
p250_273 There will be widespread support on all sides
p250_274 Messages have to be reinforced
p250_275 I got a yellow card
p250_276 This is no reflection on Rangers
p250_277 We accept the new rules
p250_278 They are interior designers and architects
p250_280 I rejected the idea of a separate residence
p250_281 Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes
p250_282 We are aiming for early March
p250_283 I felt about this big
p250_284 And they were being paid ?
p250_285 was everything done to save people ?
p250_286 What was the matter for concern ?
p250_287 Do I think about them often ?
p250_288 Is it in the right place ?
p250_289 It is also very valuable
p250_290 I feel really confident in that department
p250_291 This could put pressure on UK inflation
p250_292 Companies have only recently been allowed to compete on price
p250_293 The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack
p250_294 I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight
p250_295 We shall rely on human beings
p250_296 It has the potential to be another North Sea
p250_297 We would have no control over the threshold for repayment
p250_298 He has not created a Festival resource
p250_299 Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate
p250_300 I understand the security issue
p250_301 Frankly, we should all have such problems
p250_302 It was an easy decision to come here
p250_304 He ran into immediate problems with local people and police
p250_305 Funding would come from both Scotland and Northern Ireland
p250_306 No-one wanted to run it tonight
p250_308 We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service
p250_309 She has fallen in love with Scotland, however
p250_310 You have to expect this type of thing
p250_311 Stephen will get his first cap
p250_312 However, he will have his work cut out defending his title
p250_313 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p250_314 The circumstances have changed since last year
p250_315 It's all designed to speed up the service
p250_316 I wanted to change the formula
p250_317 He will address the nation this evening
p250_318 I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh
p250_319 Motherwell have no such good fortune
p250_320 We would hope to make progress on that next year
p250_321 Again the parallel with football can be drawn
p250_322 The effect was almost magical
p250_323 And that culture is everywhere In Dublin
p250_324 Holland won by five wickets
p250_325 There's still no-one like him
p250_326 McNaughton was not so sure
p250_327 I was brought up in a mining background
p250_328 I thought his speech was a disgrace
p250_329 The takeover comes as no surprise
p250_330 Job losses were also announced
p250_331 A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election
p250_332 We believe the world has too many refugees already
p250_333 The party lasted all night
p250_334 Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school
p250_335 It was nice to finish in style
p250_336 They would now be able to look forward with confidence
p250_337 Completion of the purchase is seen by the end of the year
p250_338 And he goes with it
p250_339 SCOTLAND has shown the way
p250_340 There will be good prospects ahead
p250_341 Will have consequences for Scottish universities
p250_342 The letters are going out today
p250_343 I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record
p250_344 We will listen to any suggestion
p250_345 The Premier League has been a huge success
p250_346 He has made his base in Spain
p250_348 A Home Office spokesman said
p250_349 Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis
p250_350 That is a trend which will be encouraged
p250_351 It was tough to contain the excitement
p250_352 The pain is still acute
p250_353 Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items
p250_354 It's wonderful to have won
p250_355 Many of these properties are located in the south of England
p250_356 I'd like to take the plunge
p250_357 Finally came the moment of truth
p250_358 We have very limited capacity
p250_359 Is our children learning ?
p250_360 What form did that take ?
p250_361 Are they free ?
p250_362 Is there a waiting list ?
p250_363 In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations
p250_364 Three years ago he would have been
p250_365 It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem
p250_366 Look at the Liberal Democrats
p250_367 The Allies intend to maintain the average
p250_368 We put our bid in last night
p250_369 He had no access to the database
p250_370 We're still the only ones in the High Street
p250_371 I was delighted to accept
p250_372 They should take their mobile phones
p250_374 It's fantastic to win again
p250_375 We are really good friends
p250_376 The salary changes are long overdue
p250_377 Those people must be accountable
p250_378 She said they would appeal
p250_379 The countryside is in crisis
p250_380 There is no deal as yet
p250_381 It's as wide as a church in here
p250_382 She is obviously very disappointed
p250_383 In addition, it was in breach of natural justice
p250_384 They will fight for everything
p250_385 We will win the argument
p250_386 Is it worth it ?
p250_387 Does it matter ?
p250_388 How do you take them away ?
p250_389 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p250_390 After the match, do you ?
p250_391 The team hadn't been picked
p250_392 No other job in world football can compare to this one
p250_393 One-third of the places are already taken
p250_394 I always knew she was funny
p250_395 Everyone could see the joke
p250_396 The marshall at the turn was great
p250_397 There isn't the seriousness of other businesses
p250_398 He has earned the right to their respect
p250_399 The law would appear to be on our side
p250_400 There was a substantial explosion
p250_401 The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful
p250_402 Theatre is not a museum
p250_403 The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account
p250_404 It has only been rumours
p250_405 I was conceived in Aberdeen
p250_406 Rugby is a hard game
p250_407 My immune system had been depleted
p250_408 Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked
p250_409 This big issue is whether it can be enforced
p250_410 Growth will come later in the cycle
p250_411 We're not taking any risks
p250_412 Neither man has been charged
p250_413 I had a fortunate war
p250_414 The choice is strictly personal
p250_415 It's too close to call
p250_416 The breakdown was much later in her life
p250_417 It became a national network
p250_418 It is a large number
p250_419 She started to put on weight
p250_420 I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters
p250_421 I wouldn't want to miss that chance
p250_422 The BBC was a disgrace
p250_423 Russell is delighted with them
p250_424 The next few months will tell
p250_425 It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped
p250_426 The second goal was superb
p250_427 I am astonished at attack
p250_428 There is a solution, she believes
p250_429 That was the agreement with the manager
p250_430 He's had to suffer for the last six years
p250_431 His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son
p250_432 Being captain of this club is fantastic
p250_433 First Minister Donald Dewar will respond
p250_434 The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position
p250_435 No date has been fixed for his return
p250_436 Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt
p250_437 The trial will open today
p250_438 National Farmer's Union of Scotland president, Jim Walker, welcomed the new proposals
p250_439 I never won a penny throughout my career
p250_440 THIS is a good day for Scottish farming
p250_441 There were a lot of emotions
p250_442 We have not yet received a letter from the Irish
p250_443 However, the players should have a voice in these matters
p250_444 We know about the crisis in cattle
p250_445 Everything in golf is a balance
p250_446 Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities
p250_447 External auditors will monitor the action which is planned
p250_448 The people around me were fantastic
p250_449 That will be best for him
p250_450 And we might go back
p250_451 The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland
p250_452 The villagers were shot in the head at short range
p250_453 But you can go beyond that condition
p250_454 The removal would take place in France
p250_455 It is a tough game but we have a chance
p250_456 But we have built a platform for next season
p250_457 I think the goalkeeper should have gone
p250_458 They had learned from the lessons of the first game
p250_459 The jury is still out
p250_460 It was like someone had died
p250_461 The budget was too low for that
p250_462 Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up
p250_463 Striking the deal has come as a big relief
p250_464 The damage is all inside
p250_465 Let that be their memorial
p250_466 The boys are mentally focused
p250_467 This is the stuff of live music
p250_468 It may prove to be his last involvement with the club
p250_469 The move is considered a major breakthrough
p250_471 I see no reason to have this debate at this time
p250_472 He certainly did a good job!
p250_473 Talks between directors have been underway since last month
p250_474 I am certainly thinking about retirement
p250_475 At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues
p250_476 I have always believed in myself
p250_477 The chief constable has retired
p250_478 Well, he is an artist
p250_479 Her body was found about four miles from the car
p250_480 The casting of her husband was an accident
p250_481 Their coach is obviously under a lot of pressure
p250_482 That was the first time I worked with Richard
p250_483 That argument has been won
p250_484 It was a narrow escape
p250_485 And rugby fans can help
p250_486 He was certainly upbeat about his chances
p250_487 The processing plant was closed yesterday
p250_488 The Israeli military denied the claim
p250_489 He is not a dancer
p250_490 I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart
p250_491 IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock
p250_492 These people attack the core of my beliefs
p250_493 The striker needed attention before he could resume
p250_494 I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie
p250_495 We would welcome a commercial partner or partners
p250_496 Subsidy income will not be affected
p254_001 Please call Stella
p254_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p254_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p254_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p254_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p254_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p254_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p254_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p254_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p254_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p254_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p254_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p254_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p254_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p254_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p254_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p254_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p254_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p254_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p254_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p254_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p254_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p254_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p254_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p254_025 Johnson was pretty low
p254_026 But it failed
p254_027 They may be wrong
p254_028 I am not interested in the money, it is the principle
p254_029 They should have a major rethink about the event for next year
p254_030 The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date
p254_031 Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed
p254_032 So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic
p254_033 It's a matter of balance
p254_034 We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude
p254_035 Then, suddenly, they weren't
p254_037 They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life
p254_038 However, they continued in their pursuit of victory
p254_039 They're just different
p254_040 It was clear
p254_041 It is not for any other purpose
p254_042 The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic
p254_043 I was scared
p254_044 However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials
p254_045 No meaningful response was issued
p254_046 That period was a struggle
p254_047 I am just going to go for it
p254_048 Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man
p254_049 This represents a tough game for us
p254_050 It's a crucial award
p254_051 We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there
p254_052 That should do it
p254_053 It's a blessing
p254_054 Is a drug dealer?
p254_055 But it might have done
p254_056 That time has passed
p254_057 The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids
p254_058 He is too weak to move
p254_059 Life is good
p254_060 It is the whole package
p254_061 This is a club on the rise
p254_062 He had no enemies
p254_063 For the meantime, though, the signs are good
p254_064 We were surprised to see the photograph
p254_065 That's the day job
p254_066 In the current outbreak, the reverse is true
p254_067 This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers
p254_068 It is not a process which can be completed overnight
p254_069 My mother is a widow
p254_070 The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine
p254_071 Jobs could go
p254_072 Four other charges were dropped
p254_073 They're appalled by that
p254_074 There was a battle there
p254_075 It's good news and long overdue
p254_076 And if he hadn't become a musician?
p254_077 Charles Kennedy had an effective outing
p254_078 They never gave up hope
p254_079 It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards
p254_080 Painful, but only because it's true
p254_081 It's all I can do
p254_082 The company yesterday refused to comment
p254_083 Both sides have been hit by injury
p254_084 The price cuts are really exciting
p254_085 My office is bare
p254_086 Is there a new way forward?
p254_087 There was an e-mail
p254_088 Even the one she loved
p254_090 Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits
p254_091 It may well have been
p254_092 However, we will obviously keep the matter under review
p254_093 He liked to give the impression of being a hard man
p254_094 Last week, he was taken into hospital
p254_095 He seems to be pleased with the picture
p254_096 All options are open
p254_097 You will be
p254_098 Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall
p254_099 And rugby fans can help
p254_100 Now the system is right behind us
p254_101 However, it did not end that way
p254_102 This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager
p254_103 The group is due to report by the end of the year
p254_104 I love the Dome
p254_105 Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom
p254_106 The selection process is still at a very early stage
p254_107 Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights
p254_108 However, we have not come to any conclusions
p254_109 But it was a pleasure
p254_110 He takes the job
p254_111 It was an adventure
p254_112 That all hope is never lost
p254_113 And I thought - we have to do something with this
p254_114 It was really enjoyable on Saturday
p254_115 It is normal
p254_116 I was fighting for my life, I thought
p254_117 We need to handle it
p254_118 Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin
p254_119 It's a long process
p254_120 They were behind the wheel
p254_121 The fire was above the hole
p254_122 This is a scheme that has a lot of potential
p254_123 We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail
p254_124 Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants
p254_125 I could see his desire for the job in his eyes
p254_126 I joined a group
p254_127 Does this mean
p254_128 Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month
p254_129 It is a job creation scheme
p254_130 It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged
p254_131 I'm so angry
p254_132 Child abuse is a dreadful thing
p254_133 It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation
p254_134 They keep the atmosphere in mind
p254_135 It's terrible that he has died the same way
p254_136 The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk
p254_137 It plans to return to this field
p254_138 Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll
p254_139 Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general
p254_140 Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October
p254_141 Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg
p254_143 I was the last man to touch the ball
p254_144 Three penalties were given
p254_145 We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football
p254_146 He is severe
p254_147 It is difficult for Ali
p254_148 There is a lack of chemistry
p254_149 This is the way things should be handled
p254_150 He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative
p254_151 Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition
p254_152 It is not just about pay
p254_153 Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday
p254_154 You know the type
p254_155 The weaknesses are few
p254_156 The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight
p254_157 I was in daily contact
p254_158 We will turn the corner
p254_159 This latter point is hugely important
p254_160 Inside, the atmosphere was quiet
p254_161 It has been a lovely family occasion
p254_162 He's a nice guy
p254_163 It has to be now
p254_164 They are not advertised
p254_165 I have got a wife to feed
p254_166 Tell it like it was?
p254_167 It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful
p254_168 Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final
p254_169 We started to struggle with each other towards the end
p254_170 Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut
p254_171 He was a crazy man
p254_172 They might be broken, but they are not defeated
p254_173 First and foremost, the game is entirely different
p254_174 However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service
p254_175 It was a great achievement to win at Wembley
p254_176 It is not either national standards or local control
p254_177 The clarity is vital
p254_178 The hotel was now for sale
p254_179 Tony had arrived
p254_180 He will need that machine
p254_181 I was totally wrong
p254_182 We did everything by the book
p254_183 We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome
p254_184 However, this idea is never developed
p254_185 I grew up listening to these people
p254_186 The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small
p254_187 Peace was won
p254_188 It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work
p254_189 I wanted to put myself on the line
p254_190 Off I went
p254_191 The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address
p254_192 Is that it?
p254_193 The conference is the first test
p254_194 On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult
p254_195 The sisters also became the top two players in the world
p254_196 I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February
p254_197 They've got three-quarters of the way
p254_198 The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster
p254_199 Today was first class
p254_200 We will give a formal response to the report in due course
p254_201 We have an election in eight days
p254_202 It's like a garage
p254_203 But I am a worried man
p254_204 This gives a financial incentive to switch
p254_205 That is an important part of our role
p254_206 It is a small part, and it's very small in the book
p254_207 We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence
p254_208 I began to pray
p254_209 A Grampian Police spokesman said
p254_210 His third goal was superb
p254_211 It's not ideal
p254_212 The FBI could become involved
p254_213 On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football
p254_214 The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument
p254_215 But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition
p254_216 A career as a doctor is on hold
p254_217 You have to do your research
p254_218 Saturday is gone
p254_219 We played them off the pitch
p254_220 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p254_221 Clearly, the stakes are high
p254_222 The boy is no longer with us
p254_223 The track is currently covered in snow
p254_224 They are the innocent victims
p254_225 It's so special
p254_226 Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern
p254_227 At the time, he was a living legend
p254_228 Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable
p254_229 Gerhard Schroeder was the victor
p254_230 They tried to give her advice
p254_231 And thought we would get away with it
p254_232 We were a load of rubbish
p254_233 They should come forward
p254_234 It is not the message alone
p254_235 He will make a statement on the dispute in the Commons tomorrow
p254_236 The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days
p254_237 It's a lovely, lovely film
p254_238 But it's a subtle process
p254_239 The Home Office would not release any further details about the group
p254_240 My future is in the marathon
p254_241 They are all bright and different
p254_242 Chambers said he would accept the place
p254_243 I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday
p254_244 In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify
p254_245 The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery
p254_246 He got the same story
p254_247 Washington is consumed by the crisis
p254_248 I was shocked
p254_249 He's a lovely young man
p254_250 There's the mix
p254_251 There will be widespread support on all sides
p254_252 This year I understood
p254_253 That could be in place by next year
p254_254 I was never going to play against Scotland
p254_255 It's a source of deep concern
p254_256 For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique
p254_257 However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely
p254_258 The pensioners did not want to know
p254_259 It is also very valuable
p254_260 This court has made an order which has not been observed
p254_261 The work between the musicians and the fire is very important
p254_262 He thought he had a month to cross the street
p254_263 That decision is for the British Parliament and people
p254_264 They want to shut the Scottish Office
p254_265 There is no link
p254_266 This is a question of Islam
p254_267 The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision
p254_268 He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant
p254_269 Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public
p254_270 It was an easy decision to come here
p254_271 We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians
p254_272 It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence
p254_273 Everything will fall into place, it should be fine
p254_275 Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry
p254_276 Sadly, the revival could not be sustained
p254_277 It's a way of life
p254_278 She has fallen in love with Scotland, however
p254_279 However, he will have his work cut out defending his title
p254_280 People have no choice
p254_281 If not, he should go home
p254_282 For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray
p254_283 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p254_284 You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel
p254_285 I saw it at a ruck
p254_286 This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter
p254_287 What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p254_288 He will address the nation this evening
p254_289 The mood is good
p254_290 It's like a high school play
p254_291 The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together
p254_292 This is a national crisis
p254_293 Well, he can do it
p254_294 These figures are truly awful
p254_295 That could change
p254_296 Who can predict?
p254_297 In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat
p254_298 One was a lawyer
p254_299 It is a road of death
p254_300 The plot is minimal
p254_301 The court was shown a video of the house on that day
p254_302 I did not name it
p254_303 We have waited a long time for this
p254_304 Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision
p254_305 They were fantastic
p254_306 We are a peaceful people
p254_307 Craig is a major concern for us
p254_308 The problems began a long time ago
p254_309 My body is clearly capable
p254_310 It is out there
p254_311 He said she was mad
p254_312 In the old days, it was easy
p254_313 We are in the end game
p254_314 They will certainly be visible from every house in our area
p254_315 It is a strong case
p254_316 The parents will have a great time, too
p254_317 Donald was his friend
p254_318 He was not a big name
p254_319 The police have to act to help them
p254_320 It was no secret that I wanted to sign him
p254_321 The boat was fantastic
p254_322 It's not long enough
p254_323 My first concern is for the safety of the public
p254_324 Later in the day he was forced to explain his position
p254_326 Finally, he paid for the movie
p254_327 You have to be able to deal with all age groups
p254_329 It would appear that it has not been a problem
p254_330 They haven't got a hope
p254_331 It has moved on in the last week
p254_332 I'm so pleased the show has won a prize
p254_333 Today she has been released
p254_334 The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper
p254_335 It should be a great game, though
p254_336 It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet
p254_337 It should be scrapped
p254_338 A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference
p254_339 It was good for us that they lost that day
p254_340 They should take their mobile phones
p254_341 It is not like working for a living
p254_342 Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance
p254_343 It is long gone
p254_344 The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police
p254_345 Tell us about it
p254_346 It's all going to clear the debt
p254_347 That is a break with tradition
p254_348 A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company
p254_349 It was very formal
p254_350 I kept going for her
p254_351 The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow
p254_352 But the real problem is the closure of the export market
p254_353 No other job in world football can compare to this one
p254_354 Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors
p254_355 We will be homeless
p254_356 New Zealand rugby is totally different
p254_357 On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options
p254_358 It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak
p254_359 His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday
p254_360 We have to be sure that the taxation system can work
p254_361 Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world
p254_362 The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season
p254_363 There was no option
p254_364 It's now down in black and white
p254_365 Now, though, he has an incentive
p254_366 It seemed a moving and fitting tribute
p254_367 They received a reply from their own managers
p254_368 But I managed
p254_369 Five members were disciplined
p254_370 Talks are progressing
p254_371 They play together perfectly
p254_372 Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits
p254_373 It's a record label, not a form of music
p254_374 It became a national network
p254_375 It is a large number
p254_376 We felt at the moment, it was not possible
p254_377 Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter
p254_378 He has the edge
p254_379 Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe
p254_380 Florida is the pivotal state in the nation
p254_381 Face to face
p254_382 I am very happy with life
p254_383 I'm just enjoying every match
p254_384 The service would also make a massive impact on tourism
p254_385 Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director
p254_386 Family liaison officers are now working to support the family
p254_387 We have to reduce the number of plastic bags
p254_388 They really did a great job
p254_389 At the last I found a bunker
p254_390 Yet the data is compelling
p254_391 Perhaps the time has come to put the cup in a museum
p254_392 I would have loved to play in an Old Firm
p254_393 I'm pleased about one thing
p254_394 It is also claimed that he was murdered
p254_395 Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance
p254_396 We're looking for justice
p254_397 I can lead by example
p254_398 Eriksson would have approved
p254_399 Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime
p254_400 It was a breathtaking moment
p254_401 It really is a gift to the world
p254_402 The car was just there
p254_403 It was on fire
p256_001 Please call Stella
p256_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p256_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p256_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p256_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p256_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p256_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p256_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p256_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p256_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p256_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p256_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p256_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p256_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p256_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p256_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p256_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p256_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p256_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p256_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p256_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p256_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p256_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p256_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p256_025 It's a relief that a decision has finally been made
p256_026 We have to pull together, or we will hang apart
p256_027 I have a theory
p256_028 Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed
p256_029 There's a story, too
p256_030 I was an athlete
p256_031 Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist
p256_032 They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide
p256_033 Then, suddenly, they weren't
p256_034 A web site is planned for November
p256_035 It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise
p256_036 Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night
p256_037 At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough
p256_038 They're just different
p256_039 It's a real threat
p256_040 Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack
p256_041 It had been played at festivals
p256_042 Indeed, he does
p256_043 She is believed to be in South Africa
p256_044 This film will be totally awesome
p256_045 No meaningful response was issued
p256_046 That period was a struggle
p256_047 A neighbour said
p256_048 It's a crucial award
p256_049 It is difficult for Ali
p256_050 It's a blessing
p256_051 Is a drug dealer?
p256_052 It has been a horrible, horrible time
p256_053 I would love to have him home
p256_054 No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death
p256_055 He had no enemies
p256_056 Sadly, it can't
p256_057 There would appear to be no motive for the attack
p256_058 It is unique
p256_059 It is not a process which can be completed overnight
p256_060 That's the truth
p256_061 That is very hard, alone
p256_062 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p256_063 The problems are a result of that shortfall
p256_064 And a film maker was born
p256_065 It's a matter of balance
p256_066 The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow
p256_067 George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision
p256_068 They may yet have the last laugh
p256_069 There was a battle there
p256_070 They are real
p256_071 There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music
p256_072 I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset
p256_073 It should be devolved
p256_074 Charles Kennedy had an effective outing
p256_075 I was as strong as a horse
p256_076 Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision
p256_077 The girls are so lucky to be alive
p256_078 IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does
p256_079 The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow
p256_080 It is a terrible place
p256_081 I've got the shirt
p256_082 This is the way things should be handled
p256_083 It is not long term, but I need time to recover
p256_084 It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies
p256_085 It may well have been
p256_086 I first met him last summer
p256_087 Last week, he was taken into hospital
p256_088 He seems to be pleased with the picture
p256_089 It's never too late
p256_090 It was nice
p256_091 We do not get that impression now
p256_092 The city council is a major property owner in the area
p256_093 That will come after the game on Saturday
p256_094 A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue
p256_095 We must look forward
p256_096 I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself
p256_097 They've got to account for it
p256_098 She told The Herald
p256_099 It was clear
p256_100 There was no rescue
p256_101 We could not get any possession
p256_102 They are now divorced
p256_103 The court heard he drove into the path of a car
p256_104 Journalists should make him
p256_105 A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury
p256_106 Get to know him
p256_107 But it was a pleasure
p256_108 We have every respect for Michelle
p256_109 But they did not even get a reply to their letter
p256_110 I didn't play well last year
p256_111 Before the game we went for a pint
p256_112 They will want to perform well
p256_113 It's not perfect
p256_114 It was the eighties
p256_115 They were behind the wheel
p256_116 This is a step backwards
p256_117 It was ugly
p256_118 It would not do any harm to reinforce the message
p256_119 I joined a group
p256_120 It is rubbish
p256_121 Who would be a referee?
p256_122 That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships
p256_123 There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end
p256_124 The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment
p256_125 We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors
p256_126 There were no grounds for his action
p256_127 Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton
p256_128 Child abuse is a dreadful thing
p256_129 His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years
p256_130 They keep the atmosphere in mind
p256_131 Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family
p256_132 Well, you can have a tree
p256_133 Who will attend?
p256_134 Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre
p256_135 The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council
p256_136 Our intentions are real
p256_137 It is also well received
p256_138 We never said that we would walk through the third division
p256_139 Police could not say if the two incidents were connected
p256_140 It was very frightened and dirty
p256_141 We want to keep the pound
p256_142 And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life
p256_143 The way he took his second goal was brilliant
p256_144 It changed my life
p256_145 Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition
p256_146 It is not just about pay
p256_147 The home side didn't stand a chance
p256_148 I was so nervous
p256_149 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p256_150 They have not been named
p256_151 There's a sense of excess in the novel
p256_152 We should be clear about the role of government
p256_153 It was by the numbers
p256_154 She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers
p256_155 We will turn the corner
p256_156 This year, this month, will be special for Torrance
p256_157 He can do no wrong
p256_158 Alex has been a huge influence on the club
p256_159 These days are long gone
p256_160 I will tell you
p256_161 A Labour insider said it was far too close to call
p256_162 It has to be now
p256_163 We have to move forward
p256_164 They are not advertised
p256_165 We knew we had the goal we wanted
p256_166 It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful
p256_167 By then, however, both men were already in the US
p256_168 Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final
p256_169 The post will be unpaid
p256_170 Does that put pressure on us?
p256_171 Waiting times for these services are too long
p256_172 It is too much for me
p256_173 We've made a couple of albums
p256_174 It is not either national standards or local control
p256_175 If that's the case, he will struggle
p256_176 The hotel was now for sale
p256_177 The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate
p256_178 They took a risk
p256_179 I have the first six months of next season to prove myself
p256_180 There is no point in looking any further
p256_181 Nothing is safe
p256_182 They will run a mile
p256_183 Four policemen were wounded
p256_184 They receive a high profile in the media
p256_185 We did everything by the book
p256_186 They need to look after themselves
p256_187 I saw military vehicles in the distance
p256_188 My main concern is that public health is not put at risk
p256_189 It is a terrible loss
p256_190 Suddenly, the rugby world had changed
p256_191 If the director is with you
p256_192 I am totally surprised
p256_193 I grew up listening to these people
p256_194 The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small
p256_195 Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament
p256_196 It is a case of taking a risk
p256_197 I wanted to put myself on the line
p256_198 It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council
p256_199 People acted too quickly
p256_200 I have a cold
p256_201 The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions
p256_202 Tommy is not a problem
p256_203 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p256_204 They've got three-quarters of the way
p256_205 But she might be
p256_206 It was worth a photograph
p256_207 After that time, the market itself will set the prices
p256_208 It's like a garage
p256_209 But I am a worried man
p256_210 HARRY Potter has lost his magic
p256_211 She should not be blamed
p256_212 It had all been arranged
p256_213 The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans
p256_214 The FBI could become involved
p256_215 A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar
p256_216 The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers
p256_217 On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football
p256_218 The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo
p256_219 We've got the bronze
p256_220 It's so special
p256_221 We will be victorious
p256_222 He seemed to lose his focus
p256_223 At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher
p256_224 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p256_225 I am immensely sad
p256_226 It is a gamble
p256_227 My neighbours are horrified
p256_228 The track is currently covered in snow
p256_229 I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision
p256_230 They are the innocent victims
p256_231 My wife and family are the support system
p256_232 The body follows the mind
p256_233 It is set in Paris
p256_234 It's quite nice
p256_235 It's a lovely, lovely film
p256_236 A succession of managers in the opera company resigned
p256_237 However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart
p256_238 The Home Office would not release any further details about the group
p256_239 He was good, but not that good
p256_240 He claimed the government had lost the plot
p256_241 Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order
p256_242 It would appear that it has not been a problem
p256_243 It is hard won
p256_244 He says that he is no different from any other man
p256_245 The scene is about this?
p256_246 Some families have even requested to leave the city
p256_247 We will need to study the report before any decision is taken
p256_248 In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win
p256_249 I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal
p256_250 It was a hit
p256_251 There will be widespread support on all sides
p256_252 Her presence was almost everywhere
p256_253 I was never going to play against Scotland
p256_254 At the end of the day, one has to be careful
p256_255 That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective
p256_256 The bottom line is that we had to get a win
p256_257 Chelsea was a great club
p256_258 That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match
p256_259 One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning
p256_260 It is a mark of respect from the inmates
p256_261 Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London
p256_262 I am very angry
p256_263 The pensioners did not want to know
p256_264 I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean
p256_265 He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky
p256_266 Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention
p256_267 That's the only thing I will say
p256_268 It looks as though he will be right
p256_269 Of course, that is not the whole story
p256_270 He has not created a Festival resource
p256_271 Frankly, we should all have such problems
p256_272 It was an easy decision to come here
p256_273 And Michael was just great
p256_274 She has every confidence in his performance of his duties
p256_275 The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline
p256_276 I am an estate agent
p256_277 They were on holiday in Egypt
p256_278 In fact, he was talking about the survival business
p256_279 It happens from time to time
p256_280 For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray
p256_281 But I've won both ways
p256_282 I saw it at a ruck
p256_283 The attacker died in the crash
p256_284 The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies
p256_285 It's like a high school play
p256_286 Scotland were beaten again
p256_287 It's very safe
p256_288 He was obviously very genuine
p256_289 She said she could not believe that they had run away
p256_290 It shows a contempt by him for the industry
p256_291 He wrote the letter two days before he died
p256_292 The results are sometimes contentious
p256_293 The songs are just so good
p256_294 Who can predict?
p256_295 They are a total disgrace to the loyalist cause
p256_296 It became a book by itself
p256_297 The home was now under new management
p256_298 I thought it was my only chance
p256_300 One was a lawyer
p256_301 Our task is to complete the picture
p256_302 The party lasted all night
p256_303 It's so awful
p256_304 It's just not funny!
p256_305 It is no country for a man or woman of letters
p256_306 Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources
p256_307 It is no surprise
p256_308 Let's hope it's an investment in the future
p256_309 O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place
p256_310 We have waited a long time for this
p256_311 This is the culture change in medicine
p256_312 and that another interested body should have an option to buy
p256_313 This wasn't the way it was supposed to be
p256_314 It is all credit to them today
p256_315 They were fantastic
p256_316 There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh
p256_317 She is very distinctive
p256_318 It's not even finished
p256_319 Henman has been warned
p256_320 It should be equal
p257_001 Please call Stella
p257_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p257_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p257_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p257_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p257_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p257_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p257_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p257_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p257_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p257_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p257_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p257_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p257_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p257_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p257_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p257_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p257_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p257_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p257_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p257_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p257_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p257_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p257_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p257_025 We have to pull together, or we will hang apart
p257_026 Is this accurate?
p257_027 They should have a major rethink about the event for next year
p257_028 Because we do not need it
p257_029 Life was like a timetable
p257_030 Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night
p257_031 It was clear
p257_032 Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons
p257_033 I came to complete
p257_034 President Bush is at war
p257_035 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p257_036 I was scared
p257_037 It was ugly
p257_038 It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside
p257_039 It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract
p257_040 The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough
p257_041 A neighbour said
p257_042 We need to chat
p257_043 The boy is no longer with us
p257_044 I hate the word
p257_045 That should do it
p257_046 It's a blessing
p257_047 The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids
p257_048 As she explains
p257_049 Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland
p257_050 He had no enemies
p257_051 I got a great response from the players, as I had expected
p257_052 But the law is very clear on this
p257_053 For the meantime, though, the signs are good
p257_054 We were surprised to see the photograph
p257_055 Next league matches Celtic
p257_056 It's very odd
p257_057 The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine
p257_058 It is not great art
p257_059 George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision
p257_060 There was a battle there
p257_061 Scotland had great assets
p257_062 There will be tough opponents to this report
p257_063 Have a look at our accounts
p257_064 Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p257_065 There is an element of racism in Scotland
p257_066 I was just trying to win the golf tournament
p257_067 It's all I can do
p257_068 There could be a way back
p257_069 They do not work for Glasgow City Council
p257_070 The price cuts are really exciting
p257_071 Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision
p257_072 I had my suspicions
p257_073 She died in hospital two hours later
p257_074 It was chaotic
p257_075 Is there a new way forward?
p257_076 I've not thought about it
p257_077 People must remain vigilant
p257_078 Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits
p257_079 It is not long term, but I need time to recover
p257_080 It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet
p257_081 It may well have been
p257_082 He liked to give the impression of being a hard man
p257_083 He seems to be pleased with the picture
p257_084 Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games
p257_085 I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling
p257_086 It's never too late
p257_087 Florida is the pivotal state in the nation
p257_088 Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today
p257_089 Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile
p257_090 Today I couldn't run on it
p257_091 We must look forward
p257_092 It is an old family habit
p257_093 He was possessed
p257_094 She told The Herald
p257_095 Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack
p257_096 The peace process will be buried!
p257_097 The oil companies would be asked to contribute
p257_098 They are now divorced
p257_099 They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs
p257_100 It was mayhem
p257_101 However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full
p257_102 Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe
p257_103 We have every respect for Michelle
p257_104 That time is not now, however
p257_105 I didn't play well last year
p257_106 For these people, the ruling is very welcome
p257_107 They will want to perform well
p257_108 They had to be cut from the wreckage
p257_109 I did not think about the Ryder Cup
p257_110 It is normal
p257_111 I was fighting for my life, I thought
p257_112 I don't have many friends
p257_113 It's a shame
p257_114 It was the eighties
p257_115 We do not expect any surplus
p257_116 Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals
p257_117 It's not a new concept in jazz
p257_118 We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail
p257_119 I'm delighted about that
p257_120 Does this mean
p257_121 This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election
p257_122 He did his job
p257_123 You can spend money on housing
p257_124 That's all right then
p257_125 I was furious
p257_126 It has removed a bit of guilt
p257_127 His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years
p257_128 It's terrible that he has died the same way
p257_129 So the European elections are extremely important
p257_130 Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince
p257_131 Who will attend?
p257_132 The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council
p257_133 The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk
p257_134 I am now unemployed
p257_135 Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland
p257_136 They made such decisions in London
p257_137 Our intentions are real
p257_138 It is also well received
p257_139 What will happen then?
p257_140 It's not true
p257_141 I feel very grateful with everything
p257_142 We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties
p257_143 Nobody in the world can get away from him
p257_144 He sees a difference in the style of the two teams
p257_145 We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football
p257_146 There is a lack of chemistry
p257_147 That could mean the difference between life and death in action
p257_148 It is like a football team
p257_149 That group reported just before Christmas
p257_150 He will emerge as a world leader
p257_151 It opens the door to the Champions League
p257_152 They did very well
p257_153 It became a book by itself
p257_154 But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company
p257_155 The weather forecast isn't good
p257_156 There's a sense of excess in the novel
p257_157 For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon
p257_158 There's a pause
p257_159 He can do no wrong
p257_160 It was so new, so exciting
p257_161 I've learned from my mistakes
p257_162 A Labour insider said it was far too close to call
p257_163 I've put my own money into this project
p257_164 However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands
p257_165 I lost my head
p257_166 You are not going in blind
p257_167 Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final
p257_168 As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead
p257_169 And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers
p257_170 My life has been destroyed
p257_171 There was no hint of scandal
p257_172 Treatment is not an issue with these people
p257_173 I feel like my game has come a long way
p257_174 We wanted it left for a wee while
p257_175 However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service
p257_176 It's quite a routine
p257_177 There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging
p257_178 In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat
p257_179 Everyone can be bought
p257_180 It is minute
p257_181 They need to look after themselves
p257_182 What has caused the demise of singing?
p257_183 One was a lawyer
p257_184 My main concern is that public health is not put at risk
p257_185 It was an odd affair, in many respects
p257_186 Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender
p257_187 Saturday is gone
p257_188 I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react
p257_189 Last night was a key episode
p257_190 We must keep our feet on the ground
p257_191 The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small
p257_192 Off I went
p257_193 There would appear to be no motive for the attack
p257_194 He has a lot of experience as captain in his career
p257_195 Ferguson should take note
p257_196 The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster
p257_197 It's just awful
p257_198 We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead
p257_199 IT S all in the hair
p257_200 We have an election in eight days
p257_201 But I am a worried man
p257_202 This gives a financial incentive to switch
p257_203 Saddam Hussein is a devil
p257_204 He knows a lot
p257_205 He is slightly confused
p257_206 Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre
p257_207 We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence
p257_208 I am delighted for Simon
p257_209 It had all been arranged
p257_210 A Grampian Police spokesman said
p257_211 We have got to get it right
p257_212 However, Dundee deserved to win this game
p257_213 I might come back
p257_214 His death was a tragic accident
p257_215 It's just a place to open it
p257_216 He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda
p257_217 Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E
p257_218 William Hague delighted his party
p257_219 At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher
p257_220 We played them off the pitch
p257_221 She really suffered for her art
p257_222 He demanded to speak to the boss
p257_223 Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern
p257_224 Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable
p257_225 I think he's the favourite, no question
p257_226 Broke the birdie record
p257_227 They had no children
p257_228 It is set in Paris
p257_229 Well, they were the unlucky ones
p257_230 The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days
p257_231 On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence
p257_232 John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, will fly to the summit tomorrow
p257_233 But it's a subtle process
p257_234 The Home Office would not release any further details about the group
p257_235 My future is in the marathon
p257_236 Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order
p257_237 A change in that position would require a decision by the council
p257_238 They may yet have the last laugh
p257_239 You can feel at home in China
p257_240 It is a policy which has the full support of the minister
p257_241 I should think so, too
p257_242 We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre
p257_243 I didn't need to watch it on the video
p257_244 He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic
p257_245 I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry
p257_246 We need to move away from the culture of long hours
p257_247 He said he intended to push for a judicial review
p257_248 He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather
p257_249 I watched a game
p257_250 They are interior designers and architects
p257_251 There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement
p257_252 they fail to engage
p257_253 It is a mark of respect from the inmates
p257_254 I would have the hammer in the crowd
p257_255 He thought he had a month to cross the street
p257_256 He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky
p257_257 Blood samples were taken
p257_258 He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant
p257_259 It's very nice
p257_260 Frankly, we should all have such problems
p257_261 Similar measures are expected in England and Wales
p257_262 We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians
p257_263 And Michael was just great
p257_264 We're in shock
p257_265 Everything will fall into place, it should be fine
p257_266 Our objective is to tackle poverty
p257_267 One knows the feeling
p257_268 She has fallen in love with Scotland, however
p257_269 She looked so young
p257_270 It was a privilege to work for him
p257_271 For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray
p257_272 He looked very sharp
p257_273 You've got to have both sides
p257_274 Who did the recruiting?
p257_275 Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people
p257_276 Well, he can do it
p257_277 It shows a contempt by him for the industry
p257_278 It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland
p257_279 He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained
p257_280 The results are sometimes contentious
p257_281 He should have won
p257_282 A new school will be built
p257_283 Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen
p257_284 That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients
p257_285 What has altered?
p257_286 The home was now under new management
p257_287 Graeme was prepared
p257_288 I thought it was my only chance
p257_289 However, the snow was welcomed by some
p257_290 It just came into my head that day
p257_291 They are wrong
p257_292 Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday
p257_293 It's just not funny!
p257_294 I am very happy to be here
p257_295 The plot is minimal
p257_296 It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing
p257_297 A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe
p257_298 This is the culture change in medicine
p257_299 and that another interested body should have an option to buy
p257_300 They were fantastic
p257_301 I never thought it would take this long
p257_302 In fact, they have the opposite effect
p257_303 They wanted the club to make money
p257_304 Kids are terrible
p257_305 Henman has been warned
p257_306 It should be equal
p257_307 Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure
p257_308 The home team had an amazing start
p257_309 It is out there
p257_310 They had a confession
p257_311 Davis is very supportive, as a director
p257_312 We are in the end game
p257_313 I came into this world with nothing
p257_314 But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament
p257_315 I am so upset
p257_316 The boat was fantastic
p257_317 I saw some good things
p257_318 Finally, he paid for the movie
p257_319 You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel
p257_320 In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times
p257_321 Three years ago he would have been
p257_322 You feel the pride
p257_323 It is so unfair
p257_324 The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper
p257_325 Indeed, it was magical
p257_326 I've got no secret
p257_327 Look at the witnesses
p257_328 I'm very lucky
p257_329 We must do something
p257_330 He says that he is no different from any other man
p257_331 Alex Ferguson is the same
p257_332 I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil
p257_333 Like his acting, it was an accident
p257_334 It is not like working for a living
p257_335 It is long gone
p257_336 The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police
p257_337 Tell us about it
p257_338 The salary changes are long overdue
p257_339 He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal
p257_340 It was very formal
p257_341 The pressure is on Celtic in the main
p257_342 Tyson is overwhelmed
p257_343 We are delighted at the response from potential employers
p257_344 I wanted to go out on a high
p257_345 Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors
p257_346 I felt really good until Friday
p257_347 His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday
p257_348 He could face a jail sentence
p257_349 For one veteran, the memories remain vivid
p257_350 I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself
p257_351 I am not willing to say anything about any couple
p257_352 Then followed a bout of flu
p257_353 There is no signature
p257_354 It's a long process
p257_355 It is a large number
p257_356 He knew his job inside out
p257_357 I wouldn't want to miss that chance
p257_358 Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter
p257_359 It does not even have a staff shortage
p257_360 I haven't had a kick at a Celtic player for a while
p257_361 He has the edge
p257_362 He denied the charge
p257_363 There were no casualties
p257_364 Since then, he has played no active part in the company
p257_365 YOU thought it was a headache
p257_366 Family liaison officers are now working to support the family
p257_367 A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting
p257_368 They really did a great job
p257_369 There is a solution, she believes
p257_370 However, it's good to turn the page
p257_371 This year I understood
p257_372 I'm pleased about one thing
p257_373 It is unusual
p257_374 It is also claimed that he was murdered
p257_375 It is likely the rest of the market will follow suit
p257_376 I can lead by example
p257_377 Well, it did last time, he was reminded
p257_378 They are good
p257_379 He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response
p257_380 My husband was born in Zimbabwe
p257_381 So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy
p257_382 It was on fire
p257_383 The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions
p257_384 I never won a penny throughout my career
p257_385 Emotions were complex
p257_386 He's already made history
p257_387 So I did
p257_388 You ask the question
p257_389 Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter
p257_390 There was no trouble
p257_391 This is a huge confidence boost
p257_392 Not because they want to sing about something
p257_393 It is not a standing army
p257_394 We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project
p257_395 I believe the gap is nearly there
p257_396 You wanted the evidence
p257_397 Our numbers are small
p257_398 I was very young
p257_399 We have just got to keep his feet on the ground
p257_400 I am the Son of Sam
p257_401 She is superb
p257_402 Today, he is in the same position as four years ago
p257_403 It doesn't always work that way
p257_404 It is simple, but profound
p257_405 No preference emerged
p257_406 But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat
p257_407 I've invented a village in East Lothian
p257_408 She has reached the top of her profession
p257_409 It goes with the job
p257_410 The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue
p257_411 Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline
p257_412 I recommend a tour
p257_413 We are delighted with this outcome
p257_414 I have so much respect for him
p257_415 We shall be victorious
p257_416 Rather than answer, she resigned
p257_417 War is not the action
p257_418 They said so that I would look good in uniform
p257_419 It's not about defining styles
p257_420 One must hope not!
p257_421 It is marvellous
p257_422 But it may take some time to confirm the findings
p257_423 They should not be blamed for it
p257_424 Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion
p257_425 It is bizarre
p257_426 Mary Archer is almost too clever
p257_427 I was just overwhelmed
p257_428 It had been in place since last July
p257_429 It's a miracle
p257_430 The first minister is obviously concerned to hear about this incident
p257_431 That was the first time I worked with Richard
p257_432 They will form a tribute
p257_433 The whole region is in shock
p257_434 The bill would be massive
p258_001 Please call Stella
p258_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p258_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p258_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p258_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p258_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p258_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p258_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p258_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p258_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p258_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p258_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p258_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p258_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p258_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p258_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p258_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p258_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p258_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p258_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p258_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p258_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p258_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p258_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p258_025 Johnson was pretty low
p258_026 It's nice to hear
p258_027 People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background
p258_028 They should be so lucky
p258_029 Because it's a waste of time for both sides
p258_030 However, the following year the cancer returned
p258_031 Because we do not need it
p258_032 He took me on a tour of the wards
p258_033 They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide
p258_034 I'd like to continue that record
p258_035 It was clear
p258_036 It is not for any other purpose
p258_037 President Bush is at war
p258_038 I was scared
p258_039 It will come all right
p258_040 It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside
p258_041 The judge said
p258_042 We need to chat
p258_043 It's a blessing
p258_044 As she explains
p258_045 She looked so young
p258_046 He looks like an Afghan
p258_047 It is the whole package
p258_048 I got a great response from the players, as I had expected
p258_049 We were surprised to see the photograph
p258_050 That's the day job
p258_051 We have not given up hope
p258_052 You must have a government and a good civil service
p258_053 That is very hard, alone
p258_054 It's that kind of place
p258_055 Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London
p258_056 And if he hadn't become a musician?
p258_057 He was popular
p258_058 It should be devolved
p258_059 We welcome the decision of Mr Byers
p258_060 Try to save us
p258_061 He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture
p258_062 Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p258_063 There is an element of racism in Scotland
p258_064 That was the easy election
p258_065 It's all I can do
p258_066 The price cuts are really exciting
p258_067 Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision
p258_068 The girls are so lucky to be alive
p258_069 The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow
p258_070 I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier
p258_071 He got the same story
p258_072 This is the way things should be handled
p258_073 It is not long term, but I need time to recover
p258_074 It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies
p258_075 However, we will obviously keep the matter under review
p258_076 I first met him last summer
p258_077 Last week, he was taken into hospital
p258_078 Nothing is yet confirmed
p258_079 New Zealand rugby is totally different
p258_080 We have other options
p258_081 Every time I play I do not understand their reaction
p258_082 The city council is a major property owner in the area
p258_083 Today I couldn't run on it
p258_084 They are different types
p258_085 It is a simple equation
p258_086 Until you hit the big games
p258_087 Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack
p258_088 There was no rescue
p258_089 She's got to say something
p258_090 The selection process is still at a very early stage
p258_091 Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults
p258_092 Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons
p258_093 Journalists should make him
p258_094 But it was a pleasure
p258_095 We're not seeing an image of the person, he said
p258_096 Oil embargo endorsed
p258_097 It is a good lifestyle
p258_098 Before the game we went for a pint
p258_099 Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form
p258_100 It's not perfect
p258_101 They had to be cut from the wreckage
p258_102 She has been shot
p258_103 He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald
p258_104 According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland
p258_105 We do not expect any surplus
p258_106 He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic
p258_107 It is so sad
p258_108 We have to look at everything before we make any final decision
p258_109 We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail
p258_110 This film will be totally awesome
p258_111 Maybe this battle has been
p258_112 Until the weekend he was minister for social justice
p258_113 I joined a group
p258_114 This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad
p258_115 Who would have?
p258_116 It is a delight on every level
p258_117 You can spend money on housing
p258_118 Here, again, they were denied a voice
p258_119 Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots
p258_120 There will be no shortage of quality applicants
p258_121 I could see his desire for the job in his eyes
p258_122 It has removed a bit of guilt
p258_123 She does not want to speak
p258_124 It's terrible that he has died the same way
p258_125 So the European elections are extremely important
p258_126 Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family
p258_127 Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince
p258_128 Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't
p258_129 The move has provoked a mixed response
p258_130 The role was perfect for Russell
p258_131 It plans to return to this field
p258_132 They made such decisions in London
p258_133 Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general
p258_134 My conscience is not clear
p258_135 I am totally devoted to this job
p258_136 He sees a difference in the style of the two teams
p258_137 If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden
p258_138 We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football
p258_139 Is that Titanic?
p258_140 He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context
p258_141 Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday
p258_142 It opens the door to the Champions League
p258_143 You know the type
p258_144 The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough
p258_145 The FBI could become involved
p258_146 The weather forecast isn't good
p258_147 She had gone to the Catholic school
p258_148 My Dad is a hero
p258_149 The weather affected the other two games in Fife
p258_150 Neither side can win this war
p258_151 Was this element always there?
p258_152 These days are long gone
p258_153 I've put my own money into this project
p258_154 They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today
p258_155 Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks
p258_156 They say that vital evidence was not heard in court
p258_157 Military action is the only option we have on the table today
p258_158 We have to move forward
p258_159 Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors
p258_160 We try to keep it right
p258_161 It's that sort of night
p258_162 I lost my head
p258_163 It is not too late to get on board
p258_164 Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut
p258_165 That will do for me
p258_166 They thought they had found a home
p258_167 I always felt they played for me
p258_168 Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling
p258_169 First and foremost, the game is entirely different
p258_170 IT S the real thing, for sure
p258_171 However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service
p258_172 If that's the case, he will struggle
p258_173 It should be easy
p258_174 There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging
p258_175 I drove the ball well
p258_176 Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn
p258_177 I've been there
p258_178 They will run a mile
p258_179 Four policemen were wounded
p258_180 They receive a high profile in the media
p258_181 We did everything by the book
p258_182 The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday
p258_183 He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters
p258_184 We want to help them through it
p258_185 It is a terrible loss
p258_186 We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome
p258_187 The procedure is the same in all cases
p258_188 If the director is with you
p258_189 It's very difficult to find a buyer
p258_190 I grew up listening to these people
p258_191 The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small
p258_192 It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work
p258_193 The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address
p258_194 It's the same old story
p258_195 It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council
p258_196 Is that success?
p258_197 Ferguson should take note
p258_198 They've got three-quarters of the way
p258_199 But she might be
p258_200 A deadline is still essential
p258_201 We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead
p258_202 It was worth a photograph
p258_203 It's a mixture of everything
p258_204 After that time, the market itself will set the prices
p258_205 We have an election in eight days
p258_206 The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn
p258_207 Feel the heat?
p258_208 He is slightly confused
p258_209 She should not be blamed
p258_210 Tenants will be unable to defend themselves
p258_211 It had all been arranged
p258_212 A Grampian Police spokesman said
p258_213 His third goal was superb
p258_214 It's not ideal
p258_215 We want to keep the pound
p258_216 I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery
p258_217 He seemed to lose his focus
p258_218 I might come back
p258_219 His death was a tragic accident
p258_220 On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football
p258_221 He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda
p258_222 Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement
p258_223 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p258_224 It's so special
p258_225 The loss of a company to the industry is a blow
p258_226 What was the main difference?
p258_227 It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come
p258_228 I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision
p258_229 They are the innocent victims
p258_230 My wife and family are the support system
p258_231 Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final
p258_232 They tried to give her advice
p258_233 They had no children
p258_234 We are in the hat
p258_235 They should come forward
p258_236 Well, they were the unlucky ones
p258_237 It's quite nice
p258_238 Hospitals are for the ill
p258_239 The problem in Norway is outside the National
p258_240 Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order
p258_241 They are all bright and different
p258_242 It is hard won
p258_243 It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet
p258_244 Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries
p258_245 You can feel at home in China
p258_246 It is a policy which has the full support of the minister
p258_247 It's a record label, not a form of music
p258_248 I was shocked
p258_249 I should think so, too
p258_250 We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre
p258_251 I didn't need to watch it on the video
p258_252 He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen
p258_253 Her presence was almost everywhere
p258_254 We need to move away from the culture of long hours
p258_255 Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling
p258_256 He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather
p258_257 They are interior designers and architects
p258_258 Chelsea was a great club
p258_259 It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland
p258_260 I was in jail for five years
p258_261 I am very angry
p258_262 They must play for each other
p258_263 Today we can say that a new era has begun
p258_264 It is also very valuable
p258_265 He thought he had a month to cross the street
p258_266 It's all change on the music scene in Manchester
p258_267 I saw one body
p258_268 That's the only thing I will say
p258_269 Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention
p258_270 The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision
p258_271 Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate
p258_272 Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public
p258_273 Similar measures are expected in England and Wales
p258_274 It is the same in Sweden
p258_275 Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes
p258_276 Our objective is to tackle poverty
p258_277 They were all in a stable condition last night
p258_278 It's a way of life
p258_279 The record companies have gone through the floor
p258_280 He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention
p258_281 He has a wealth of experience
p258_282 It's so awful
p258_283 For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray
p258_284 I intended to look for another club on loan
p258_285 Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished
p258_286 This is a national crisis
p258_287 The death toll included five children
p258_288 He was obviously very genuine
p258_289 It shows a contempt by him for the industry
p258_290 It was deployed in the Gulf War
p258_291 The results are sometimes contentious
p258_292 These figures are truly awful
p258_293 It's an issue that will have to be tackled
p258_294 Sunday's game was not a trial
p258_295 A new school will be built
p258_296 The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland
p258_297 Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board
p258_298 The home was now under new management
p258_299 Graeme was prepared
p258_300 In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat
p258_301 Nothing is safe
p258_302 One was a lawyer
p258_303 A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election
p258_304 The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand
p258_305 Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school
p258_306 This is a war over our home
p258_307 In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge
p258_308 Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well
p258_309 It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing
p258_310 It's certainly different
p258_311 The court was shown a video of the house on that day
p258_312 He will go a long way
p258_313 We want to play at the worlds
p258_314 Scotland were beaten again
p258_315 They were fantastic
p258_316 There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh
p258_317 Kids are terrible
p258_318 It should be equal
p258_319 The problems began a long time ago
p258_320 My body is clearly capable
p258_321 Referees are easy targets
p258_322 He said she was mad
p258_323 It is a private matter between the firm and our staff
p258_324 Davis is very supportive, as a director
p258_325 However, the groups denied the claims
p258_326 There was some merit in that
p258_327 I came into this world with nothing
p258_328 It is a strong case
p258_329 They will certainly be visible from every house in our area
p258_330 Off with their heads
p258_331 I am so upset
p258_332 I'd like to take the plunge
p258_333 Robert is a special talent
p258_334 Finally, he paid for the movie
p258_335 There was no option
p258_336 They haven't got a hope
p258_337 He did a good job
p258_338 I'm so pleased the show has won a prize
p258_339 It was so new, so exciting
p258_340 They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance
p258_341 Indeed, it was magical
p258_342 I've got no secret
p258_343 There's no place to hide
p258_344 Tiger is the exception
p258_345 Nobody else was with me
p258_346 That is the very reason why it was so vital
p258_347 The composer will conduct
p258_348 His contract was then not renewed
p258_349 I got a yellow card
p258_350 It is long gone
p258_351 Eight months later, he was dead
p258_352 A report is the first step in a criminal case in India
p258_353 I saw some good things
p258_354 The salary changes are long overdue
p258_355 He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal
p258_356 A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company
p258_357 It was very formal
p258_358 The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow
p258_359 But the real problem is the closure of the export market
p258_360 No other job in world football can compare to this one
p258_361 Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors
p258_362 We will be homeless
p258_363 That would help
p258_364 It was fit for royalty
p258_365 Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment
p258_366 It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives
p258_367 He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer
p258_368 It's not pretty, but it's effective
p258_369 I feel pretty good
p258_370 I am a star
p258_371 He could make it
p258_372 I thought he was my friend
p258_373 He could face a jail sentence
p258_374 The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland
p258_375 It took about an hour for the gas to clear
p258_376 We knew we had the goal we wanted
p258_377 Well, the big day has arrived
p258_378 I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role
p258_379 Not because they want to sing about something
p258_380 Colour was at the core of his life
p258_381 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p258_382 It was a cry for help
p258_383 Something is wrong
p258_384 It is obvious that we are engaged in a war
p258_385 It is a temptation which should be resisted
p258_386 That team is due to be announced this morning
p258_387 That's the name of the game, though
p258_388 However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely
p258_389 I was so nervous
p258_390 YOU thought it was a headache
p258_391 There is a solution, she believes
p258_392 However, it's good to turn the page
p258_393 One day, he threw the baby against a wall
p258_394 This year I understood
p258_395 Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy
p258_396 I suspect the latter
p258_397 These guys are looking for business
p258_398 He is on the wrong side
p258_399 It was a breathtaking moment
p258_400 The car was just there
p258_401 But, in fact, the reverse is true
p258_402 It is full-scale
p258_403 My house was shaking at the time
p258_404 Then , he laughs
p258_405 They are not left wing
p258_406 A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September
p258_407 We have not yet received a letter from the Irish
p258_408 He scored a touchdown
p258_409 The visual arts committee took this decision in December
p258_410 Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night
p258_411 I believe the gap is nearly there
p258_412 Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey
p258_413 Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release
p258_414 Also, it is the season of goodwill
p259_001 Please call Stella
p259_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p259_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p259_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p259_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p259_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p259_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p259_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p259_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p259_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p259_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p259_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p259_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p259_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p259_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p259_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p259_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p259_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p259_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p259_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p259_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p259_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p259_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p259_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p259_025 But it could prove disastrous

p259_044 The boy is no longer with us

p259_046 Merger would be entirely logical
p259_047 He looks like an Afghan
p259_048 They had to explain it
p259_049 I had come back from London
p259_050 Pulled a huge number of viewers
p259_051 I had trouble with the producers
p259_052 Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer
p259_053 We have not given up hope
p259_054 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p259_055 The problems are a result of that shortfall
p259_056 They had been in Scotland on exercise
p259_057 Let's hope that it does

p259_064 It wasn't possible to relax
p259_065 We should keep this recent assault in perspective
p259_066 Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom
p259_067 She died in hospital two hours later
p259_068 It is a job creation scheme
p259_069 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p259_070 Even the one she loved
p259_071 Today it was really enjoyable
p259_072 Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat
p259_073 It was a unanimous decision
p259_074 It makes for an interesting conference
p259_075 I've had it for the exams
p259_076 I first met him last summer
p259_077 I wanted to change the formula
p259_078 It gave no further details

p259_086 How are you, sir ?)
p259_087 So is that it, then ?)
p259_088 Do I have a favourite ?)

p259_091 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?)

p259_093 The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation
p259_094 Collaboration is also encouraged by the Medical Research Council and other bodies
p259_095 The allegations were still under investigation, he added
p259_096 We would have concerns about that
p259_097 Ferguson must take the blame
p259_098 Figures are not relevant to the strategy
p259_099 He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels
p259_100 It was clear on Thursday
p259_101 I did not have a bet on myself
p259_102 The selection process is still at a very early stage
p259_103 It's good to have a voice
p259_104 They will remember this victory for a while
p259_105 But they must believe in themselves
p259_106 We haven't finished the complaints procedure
p259_107 The following are the principal provisions
p259_108 It is a good lifestyle
p259_109 We needed financial backing to get it off the ground
p259_110 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p259_111 Our offer represents an attractive price for the business
p259_112 Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National
p259_113 He was jailed for a year
p259_114 The whole thing is the music
p259_115 New Year will be very busy
p259_116 The result is a vacuum
p259_117 This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service
p259_118 That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships
p259_119 We have the mental strength
p259_120 Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month
p259_121 That admission is not surprising
p259_122 In addition, investor choice is reduced
p259_123 We had another last Tuesday
p259_124 It is too pretty, it is too small
p259_125 The abuse of elderly people was appalling
p259_126 We did what we had to do
p259_127 But it is different in different regions
p259_128 They made such decisions in London
p259_129 Tiger is not the norm
p259_130 It is a variable condition and the diagnosis is difficult
p259_131 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p259_132 I am totally devoted to this job
p259_133 Before it was an ordeal
p259_134 It could be done by experts and lawyers
p259_135 Reaction to the device was mixed
p259_136 Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray
p259_137 It was started almost by accident
p259_138 Scotland will finish the group in second place
p259_139 I think he's the favourite, no question
p259_140 I'm so grateful for that
p259_141 But she was very human
p259_142 What happened in that game ?)
p259_143 Are you going to win ?)
p259_144 Was it the wife ?)
p259_145 Why change it ?)

p259_147 Does the name matter ?)
p259_148 how do you get it back ?)
p259_149 Commercial producers were present in large numbers
p259_150 The referee faces a massive job
p259_151 His second goal was equally impressive
p259_152 He was seen as the enemy
p259_153 That group reported just before Christmas
p259_154 Five minutes later, the home team were back in front
p259_155 It opens the door to the Champions League
p259_156 So I got a blood test
p259_157 No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday
p259_158 I haven't made any definite decisions
p259_159 The two companies were not for sale
p259_160 People were actually not on his side
p259_161 We have to speed up the process
p259_162 There's only one team in Ayrshire
p259_163 The weather forecast isn't good
p259_164 Nothing was meant by it
p259_165 Behind him was his brother
p259_166 It was by the numbers
p259_167 The woman was his wife
p259_168 This action reflects a slump in bookings
p259_169 He was right into football from an early age
p259_170 The Internet is no substitute for customer service
p259_171 It's never great to finish second
p259_172 You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues
p259_173 We have a budget in March
p259_174 Adventure is the champagne of life
p259_175 US is the only country to vote against resolution
p259_176 The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups
p259_177 The people are the hero
p259_178 I always felt they played for me
p259_179 You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions
p259_180 The second aspect was the fear of failure
p259_181 Phase one was a shambles
p259_182 If that's the case, he will struggle
p259_183 It is vital to clarify their role
p259_184 I'm just going to hit the shot
p259_185 Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked
p259_186 Each case is treated on merit
p259_187 It is only the beginning
p259_188 He played it like a veteran
p259_189 Our destiny is in our own hands
p259_190 That's not fair to the supporters
p259_191 We've just had it confirmed
p259_192 I will have to order its destruction
p259_193 You know the sort of thing
p259_194 I cannot say too much about them
p259_195 But there's an upturn in the sector
p259_196 It shows the strength of the roots
p259_197 I'm interested in interesting work
p259_198 Shelter also supports the reform
p259_199 We represent a wide range of society
p259_200 Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender
p259_201 It caused a lot of upset
p259_202 It had little effect on European equity markets
p259_203 This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds
p259_204 It's very difficult to find a buyer
p259_205 Neither side would reveal the details of the offer
p259_206 In due course we will make an announcement
p259_207 He should emerge as the winner
p259_208 He was then replaced by Ross
p259_209 And they were being paid ?)
p259_210 was everything done to save people ?)
p259_211 What was the matter for concern ?)
p259_212 Do I think about them often ?)
p259_213 Is it in the right place ?)
p259_214 Did he trip ?)
p259_215 For the meantime, though, the signs are good
p259_216 Here the picture is broadly stable
p259_217 This will be our new beginning
p259_218 Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon
p259_219 The early physical reports were clear
p259_220 The result is utterly compelling
p259_221 Stephen has never considered the question of compensation
p259_222 This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill
p259_223 We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead
p259_224 Little is known about them
p259_225 I won't make an official complaint
p259_226 It was worth a photograph
p259_227 The move follows a review of the Singapore)
p259_228 We have an election in eight days
p259_229 Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match
p259_230 January is a bad time of year
p259_231 HARRY Potter has lost his magic
p259_232 Today we must not repeat that mistake
p259_233 From there, they can go anywhere
p259_234 I am delighted for Simon
p259_235 It had all been arranged
p259_236 My daughter is an adult
p259_237 His third goal was superb
p259_238 It was finally agreed on Saturday
p259_239 They are difficult awards to decide
p259_240 I am considered a teenager
p259_241 Anyway, the job will be part-time
p259_242 He must get to know himself
p259_243 The transaction is not feasible
p259_244 People should make their own decisions
p259_245 The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo
p259_246 Things were so intense in the studio
p259_247 We will reform the welfare state
p259_248 His background is firmly in venture capital
p259_249 It's easy to be negative about these things
p259_250 I didn't play too well in the third quarter
p259_251 The scientific debate is dead
p259_252 Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh
p259_253 You are like an animal
p259_254 The body follows the mind
p259_255 We will try to find someone
p259_256 It had so much to do with output
p259_257 The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high
p259_258 I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight
p259_259 Half of young people had had contact with the police
p259_260 It will now be revived
p259_261 Italy is a beautiful place
p259_262 I have never heard a rule that you could be too young
p259_263 I was just a kid
p259_264 Does that put pressure on us ?)
p259_265 Did it work ?)
p259_266 Do you think we are a top nation ?)
p259_267 Is our children learning ?)
p259_268 How independent is that ?)
p259_269 What form did that take ?)
p259_270 He was good, but not that good
p259_271 He said the right things
p259_272 Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise
p259_273 I have received no explanation
p259_274 He also launched a new strategy for the agency
p259_275 Kingfisher can afford to wait
p259_276 Defensive stocks attracted some interest
p259_277 You can feel at home in China
p259_278 I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record
p259_279 Either way, the investor retains the premium
p259_280 No date has been fixed for his return
p259_281 We will listen to any suggestion
p259_282 Washington is consumed by the crisis
p259_283 I should think so, too
p259_284 It makes no difference to their friendship
p259_285 Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland
p259_286 You have got the evidence
p259_287 We accept the new rules
p259_288 It is probably in the culture
p259_289 On the contrary they stand to gain
p259_290 Blair is very positive at European Councils
p259_291 He took over our lives
p259_292 I rejected the idea of a separate residence
p259_293 I'd never run for them
p259_294 It is a mark of respect from the inmates
p259_295 They must play for each other
p259_296 These figures are truly terrible
p259_297 I felt about this big
p259_298 It is also very valuable
p259_299 There's not much money in cycling
p259_300 The stage was set for a showdown
p259_301 This could put pressure on UK inflation
p259_302 He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky
p259_303 We're trying to get rounded performers
p259_304 They can leave at any time
p259_305 We shall rely on human beings
p259_306 It has the potential to be another North Sea
p259_307 We have a high quality product
p259_308 Blair also had a penalty
p259_309 Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate
p259_310 I understand the security issue
p259_311 Frankly, we should all have such problems
p259_312 It seemed a logical expansion
p259_313 We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service
p259_314 It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow
p259_315 It's hard to see it
p259_316 The record companies have gone through the floor
p259_317 This would provide a significant and welcome boost for local employment
p259_318 It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday
p259_319 Gerhard Schroeder was the victor
p259_320 Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles
p259_321 The circumstances have changed since last year
p259_322 We will deliver at director level
p259_323 We feel very comfortable in this international environment
p259_324 I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh
p259_325 We would hope to make progress on that next year
p259_326 Again the parallel with football can be drawn
p259_327 I will never change our policy on paying appearance money
p259_328 And that culture is everywhere In Dublin
p259_329 I was just so determined
p259_330 No Briton has ever won
p259_331 Are they free ?)
p259_332 What are they for ?)
p259_333 Is there a waiting list ?)
p259_334 Do they think anyone else wants them ?)
p259_335 So what happens next ?)
p259_336 Had this been common practice ?)
p259_337 What do they want us to do ?)
p259_338 Is it worth it ?)
p259_339 His appeal is instantly understood
p259_340 The results are sometimes contentious
p259_341 The songs are just so good
p259_342 This will save interest charges
p259_343 Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme
p259_344 Sunday's game was not a trial
p259_345 Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear
p259_346 McNaughton was not so sure
p259_347 Job losses were also announced
p259_348 A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election
p259_349 The party lasted all night
p259_350 The pound has also suffered
p259_351 Scotland has shown the way
p259_352 There will be good prospects ahead
p259_353 We think the timing is good
p259_354 He will go a long way
p259_355 We want to play at the worlds
p259_356 Other people had looked at it
p259_357 The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached
p259_358 I didn't have the reply
p259_359 The output price index in December was unchanged on November
p259_360 You may have a short memory
p259_361 Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure
p259_362 A Home Office spokesman said
p259_363 Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis
p259_364 It's too horrible to think
p259_365 Hopefully, he will get a lucky break
p259_366 Industrial action has to hurt
p259_367 Nobody said it was required
p259_368 It was tough to contain the excitement
p259_369 They promised to fight the plans
p259_370 Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items
p259_371 He was unable to come
p259_372 He was at school in Devon
p259_373 Many of these properties are located in the south of England
p259_374 Finally came the moment of truth
p259_375 Whether this return was too soon
p259_376 Neither man has been charged
p259_377 An alternative must be offered
p259_378 It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped
p259_379 It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem
p259_380 He can handle it without any problem
p259_381 But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party
p259_382 He is an excellent manager
p259_383 I think we'll just keep it
p259_384 The Allies intend to maintain the average
p259_385 I've always been a sensitive
p259_386 After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction
p259_387 He had no previous convictions
p259_388 It was a massive error of judgment
p259_389 They should take their mobile phones
p259_390 Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance
p259_391 They have broken that promise
p259_392 Does it matter ?)
p259_393 How do you take them away ?)
p259_394 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?)
p259_395 After the match, do you ?)
p259_396 That is a crazy situation
p259_397 We are really good friends
p259_398 The principle is quite clear
p259_399 The salary changes are long overdue
p259_400 The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment
p259_401 She said they would appeal
p259_402 They were to blame for the first two goals
p259_403 It would be quite nice
p259_404 This remains the party's policy
p259_405 In addition, it was in breach of natural justice
p259_406 The parties include the Scottish Executive
p259_407 We will win the argument
p259_408 Everything is now in place for Manchester
p259_409 Tomorrow will be a different game entirely
p259_410 The team hadn't been picked
p259_411 The prosecution say the girl was the only witness to the attack
p259_412 It sounds like a wish list
p259_413 The director will be present
p259_414 It is the nature of his party
p259_415 Theatre is not a museum
p259_416 We have very limited capacity
p259_417 It is a serious offence of reckless conduct
p259_418 My view has now completely changed
p259_419 I had a fortunate war
p259_420 It's too close to call
p259_421 I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson
p259_422 I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters
p259_423 I've had a wonderful career
p259_424 The BBC was a disgrace
p259_425 It is hard to understand
p259_426 But the foundations have been laid
p259_427 There was an element of frustration
p259_428 In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations
p259_429 The casualties were not named
p259_430 The next few months will tell
p259_431 It is not over by any means
p259_432 A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire
p259_433 Three years ago he would have been
p259_434 They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune
p259_435 I watch the other visitors
p259_436 George is on a two-day visit to Scotland
p259_437 Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope
p259_438 This market has been neglected by the whisky industry
p259_439 There is a solution, she believes
p259_440 His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son
p259_441 It was submitted without their knowledge
p259_442 The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia
p259_443 My aim is a top six finish
p259_444 It means an enormous amount
p259_445 Such an attack is bizarre
p259_446 If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help
p259_447 I never had a childhood
p259_448 No-one wanted to run it tonight
p259_449 None of the pieces was commissioned
p259_450 There is another important factor
p259_451 I never found my rhythm
p259_452 In fact, the reasons are simple
p259_453 Strangely enough I felt very sharp
p259_454 It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes
p259_455 Nobody has told the story
p259_456 Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities
p259_457 He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review
p259_458 Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra
p259_459 The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland
p259_460 It is pretty bad news
p259_461 It certainly appeared that way
p259_462 We put our bid in last night
p259_463 Quality was high in all sections
p259_464 It could cause a little bit of disruption
p259_465 But we have built a platform for next season
p259_466 I think the goalkeeper should have gone
p259_467 They offer a kind of narrative
p259_468 She came to the Highland Show
p259_469 It was like someone had died
p259_470 They were good years for him
p259_471 Let that be their memorial
p259_472 Then came the farewell to Europe
p259_473 I'm very passionate about my country
p259_474 Phil Mickelson did that last year
p259_475 There was no trouble at all
p259_476 He deserved a red card
p259_477 The price paid for it was not disclosed
p259_478 You have to have a proven track record to get them
p259_479 Some problems were too complex
p259_480 Their one weakness was running between the wickets
p259_481 The chief constable has retired
p267_001 Please call Stella
p267_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p267_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p267_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p267_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p267_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p267_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p267_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p267_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p267_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p267_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p267_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p267_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p267_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p267_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p267_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p267_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p267_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p267_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p267_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p267_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p267_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows
p267_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p267_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p267_025 A shortlist is to be drawn up next month
p267_026 He may not need to force that message
p267_027 There is no reason at all
p267_028 Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed
p267_029 Because we do not need it
p267_030 We will look into it
p267_031 This is a central issue
p267_032 Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy
p267_033 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p267_034 I became a widow overnight
p267_035 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p267_036 A week is a long time in politics
p267_037 Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man
p267_038 This represents a tough game for us
p267_039 She hopes to study in Britain one day
p267_040 It is difficult for Ali
p267_041 The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids
p267_042 He is too weak to move
p267_043 Everything else is a bonus
p267_044 This is the interesting part
p267_045 I guess I was lucky, though
p267_046 Pulled a huge number of viewers
p267_047 Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer
p267_048 There was no safety net
p267_049 They just thought it was extremely good acting
p267_050 It is a different animal
p267_051 The City welcomed the brighter outlook
p267_052 I must take a seat
p267_053 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p267_054 Four other charges were dropped
p267_055 So I liked the challenge
p267_056 He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture
p267_057 That way I won't have to do anything
p267_058 It's just the timing of the game
p267_059 Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses
p267_060 We need to increase the membership
p267_061 He was at home with his pals
p267_062 They are in the euro
p267_063 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p267_064 How are you, sir ?
p267_065 So is that it, then ?
p267_066 Do I have a favourite ?
p267_067 There could be a way back
p267_068 They would now be able to look forward with confidence
p267_069 Her body was found on Monday morning
p267_070 They do not work for Glasgow City Council
p267_071 Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom
p267_072 A government is a government is a government
p267_073 Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator
p267_074 That is bound to happen
p267_075 He is in the queue
p267_076 He seems to be pleased with the picture
p267_077 Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money
p267_078 He can win every week
p267_079 By then, he was walking on water
p267_080 It's so hard to shift
p267_081 They lived for their children
p267_082 The cut is excellent news for the consumer
p267_083 There was no way back for United after that
p267_084 This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit
p267_085 That deal will be decided under the existing rules
p267_086 They need to find a form of words
p267_087 A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury
p267_088 It's for that reason he should resign
p267_089 The rescue package is public money
p267_090 Before the game we went for a pint
p267_091 Our house was very small
p267_092 They were a lovely couple
p267_093 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p267_094 It's not a lack of effort
p267_095 That means an extra two years
p267_096 Then came the collision with Sergio
p267_097 It is a total and utter change of culture
p267_098 Sport is good for you
p267_099 We need to handle it
p267_100 They will notice a difference
p267_102 Such actions are rarely popular
p267_103 He has done that with a great deal to spare
p267_104 Then again, we could have
p267_105 She's got to say something
p267_106 I was always a little behind
p267_107 There were no grounds for his action
p267_108 That admission is not surprising
p267_109 We have a training class
p267_110 Well, you can have a tree
p267_111 Becoming a father was wonderful
p267_112 I was on a roll
p267_113 What do we do ?
p267_114 Why do it otherwise ?
p267_115 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p267_116 The abuse of elderly people was appalling
p267_117 Something will be done by corporate bodies
p267_118 We did what we had to do
p267_119 I am the Son of Sam
p267_120 You've got to be vigilant
p267_121 Tiger is not the norm
p267_122 My conscience is not clear
p267_123 Nobody in the world can get away from him
p267_124 It would make a lot of sense
p267_125 They could use a boost
p267_126 He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative
p267_127 Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition
p267_128 They scored with a penalty and a breakaway
p267_129 He was seen as the enemy
p267_130 That group reported just before Christmas
p267_131 Five minutes later, the home team were back in front
p267_132 Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes
p267_133 It was a piece of art
p267_134 I am just trying to do my job
p267_135 So I got a blood test
p267_136 It has become a way of life
p267_137 I was caught out a little bit
p267_138 The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday
p267_139 It has to be an event
p267_140 It was deployed in the Gulf War
p267_141 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p267_142 She had gone to the Catholic school
p267_143 It is ambitious, but it can be achieved
p267_144 It was by the numbers
p267_145 We will turn the corner
p267_146 This year, this month, will be special for Torrance
p267_147 Inside, the atmosphere was quiet
p267_148 There was a definite prejudice
p267_149 Alex has been a huge influence on the club
p267_150 Not a great deal has changed in the last decade
p267_151 Adams is surely worth a chance
p267_152 That is not too bad
p267_153 We are still getting over it
p267_154 As, indeed, they would be
p267_155 We came across the first set of bodies
p267_156 Seven people were later detained by police
p267_157 I would probably have to agree with him
p267_158 We were given a warm and friendly reception
p267_159 However, he urged the trade to keep the faith
p267_160 Nobody did in those days
p267_161 So what is the campaign about ?
p267_162 And does it ?
p267_163 Are you from the rugby ?
p267_164 Had I heard ?
p267_165 Well, this article is a bit like that
p267_166 It's nice to be nice
p267_167 The people are the hero
p267_168 I always felt they played for me
p267_169 It is premature to speculate on the impact
p267_170 They made such decisions in London
p267_171 It is a body blow
p267_172 First and foremost, the game is entirely different
p267_173 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p267_174 It is not a threat
p267_175 I would not count on it
p267_176 He played it like a veteran
p267_177 I have spoken to head office
p267_178 The referee had a good game
p267_179 The European Union is a case in point
p267_180 They need to look after themselves
p267_181 It is a common problem
p267_182 A team is a team
p267_183 Aberdeen had little to offer
p267_184 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p267_185 It was a pre-emptive strike
p267_186 A terrorist is a terrorist
p267_187 People will ask about us
p267_188 I had come back from London
p267_189 This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds
p267_190 It's very difficult to find a buyer
p267_191 Final proposals will be published in February
p267_192 Tony Blair's official spokesman said
p267_193 If I was a woman
p267_194 I came home by ambulance
p267_195 I suggest a new plan
p267_196 The conference is the first test
p267_197 Tommy is not a problem
p267_198 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p267_199 He had suffered a heart attack
p267_200 I won't make an official complaint
p267_201 A bit of match fitness is required
p267_202 It is an impressive record
p267_203 There is no quick fix
p267_204 Abbey National is an option
p267_205 It has been like that all year for me
p267_206 HARRY Potter has lost his magic
p267_207 Today we must not repeat that mistake
p267_208 From there, they can go anywhere
p267_209 I had relied on him
p267_210 The course has helped a lot
p267_211 I'm just a regular person
p267_212 My life is in the ballet
p267_213 He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland
p267_214 They're going to open in early summer
p267_215 Anyway, the job will be part-time
p267_216 I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery
p267_217 It is good for our team
p267_218 It was a crazy day
p267_219 Edinburgh was not included in the survey
p267_220 Because they didn't want to know
p267_221 Women were mostly notable by their absence
p267_222 You have to do your research
p267_223 What do we want to do that for ?
p267_224 Does the name matter ?
p267_225 how do you get it back ?
p267_226 What are you not good at ?
p267_227 William Hague delighted his party
p267_228 You could feel the heat
p267_229 Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle
p267_230 The boy is no longer with us
p267_231 I didn't play too well in the third quarter
p267_232 A small number of new jobs will also be created
p267_233 My wife and family are the support system
p267_234 And he goes with it
p267_235 They tried to give her advice
p267_236 Pensions are a long-term investment
p267_237 She died in middle age
p267_238 I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight
p267_239 Those overseas offices were great
p267_240 You will have seen the adverts
p267_242 It is the loss of my name
p267_243 The irony was not lost
p267_244 We have come a long way in the last few sessions
p267_245 I am still waiting for a reply
p267_246 It is a court case
p267_247 He has been a success this year
p267_248 It might be sad, but it's a fact
p267_249 He declined to give any details
p267_250 It seems a waste of talents
p267_251 Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars
p267_252 If so, it is a funny time to introduce it
p267_253 His is a global perspective
p267_254 It is a policy which has the full support of the minister
p267_255 In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win
p267_256 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p267_257 It was a cry for help
p267_258 They were back in full training yesterday
p267_259 No production contract is yet in sight
p267_260 Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland
p267_261 There will be widespread support on all sides
p267_262 The capital costs are modest
p267_263 It was the climax of the thing
p267_264 I can't get a job
p267_265 I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board
p267_266 On the contrary they stand to gain
p267_267 This news came after the stock market closed on Monday
p267_268 It is a mark of respect from the inmates
p267_269 It does not work that way in Scottish football
p267_270 It is also very valuable
p267_271 It disappeared into the cup
p267_272 The stage was set for a showdown
p267_273 Not many companies can say that these days
p267_274 He will emerge as a world leader
p267_275 We're trying to get rounded performers
p267_276 A lot of their players have developed in the English league
p267_277 It has the potential to be another North Sea
p267_278 It is set in Paris
p267_279 He has run a hell of a race
p267_280 It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight
p267_281 He was also married with two children
p267_282 It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment
p267_283 It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players
p267_284 They failed to reach agreement yesterday
p267_285 That goes back a long way
p267_286 And they were being paid ?
p267_287 was everything done to save people ?
p267_288 What was the matter for concern ?
p267_289 Do I think about them often ?
p267_290 Stephen will get his first cap
p267_291 They were on holiday in Egypt
p267_292 The partnership was set up during the summer
p267_293 We have a plan in place
p267_294 I felt like I was a child
p267_295 Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished
p267_296 He wants to talk a lot
p267_297 The attacker died in the crash
p267_298 It is inherent in society
p267_299 He refused to name the survivors
p267_300 It's difficult to predict the future
p267_301 That is the general feeling
p267_302 I am a retailer by nature
p267_303 Well, he can do it
p267_304 The weather forecast isn't good
p267_305 The judge was really nice
p267_306 Disruption will be kept to a minimum
p267_307 It is a potential danger
p267_308 The tournament has now been cancelled
p267_309 Cast Away now on general release
p267_310 It is a road of death
p267_311 We will make a statement tomorrow
p267_312 There were no passengers on board
p267_313 You will never get a conviction
p267_314 I will not be afraid
p267_316 He has left the company
p267_317 I am not concerned with protection of the public
p267_318 People can really get themselves in a mess
p267_319 I would do away with the dress code
p267_320 He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted
p267_321 He has been told by the doctor to rest
p267_322 We want to play at the worlds
p267_323 After some discussion they did
p267_325 It is all credit to them today
p267_326 The deal was presented yesterday as a merger
p267_327 You are looking at him
p267_328 This is a source of real concern for the area
p267_329 It's not an easy life
p267_330 The election is total confusion and chaos
p267_331 It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register
p267_332 The problems began a long time ago
p267_333 It makes a compelling display
p267_334 That is a trend which will be encouraged
p267_335 But the New Year was special
p267_336 They are now out in the cold
p267_337 There was no time scale
p267_338 Does that put pressure on us ?
p267_339 Did it work ?
p267_340 Do you think we are a top nation ?
p267_341 It was tough to contain the excitement
p267_342 It is a strong case
p267_343 A report is expected next month
p267_344 The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable
p267_345 They were the acts of men
p267_346 It wasn't a flight of fancy
p267_347 He was then replaced by Ross
p267_348 Many of these properties are located in the south of England
p267_349 He is not very big, either
p267_350 I have a moral dilemma
p267_351 This might seem like an outrageous assertion
p267_352 Finally, he paid for the movie
p267_353 Last night, he pledged to clear his name
p267_354 Some will be deployed on submarines
p267_355 He did a good job
p267_356 It intends to do so on Wednesday
p267_357 It is a stroke of genius
p267_358 In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre
p267_359 We live on an island
p267_360 George Mitchell is trying to close the gap
p267_361 They have created a business
p267_362 I got a yellow card
p267_363 I am considered a teenager
p267_364 There may be reasons for it
p267_365 This is a major championship
p267_366 It's only a matter of scale
p267_367 She is now on the back benches
p267_368 They were to blame for the first two goals
p267_369 There is no deal as yet
p267_370 You must have a government and a good civil service
p267_371 to have products for their needs
p267_372 The pair are very much in love
p267_373 They are used to the big stage
p267_374 The marshall at the turn was great
p267_375 On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options
p267_376 The seller was not revealed
p267_377 People are on the alert
p267_378 Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat
p267_379 In fact, he was great today
p267_380 We operate as a Scottish company
p267_381 He has been in a nursing home for two years
p267_382 A review is under way
p267_383 They have not done so this season so far
p267_384 This big issue is whether it can be enforced
p267_385 Safety was also an issue
p267_386 We have made no final decisions
p267_387 They like being on the front pages of the newspapers
p267_388 The results will take second place
p267_389 It was a funny game
p267_390 I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role
p267_391 It does not even have a staff shortage
p267_392 The Cabinet is split over the issue
p267_393 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p267_394 Overall, the labour market continued to tighten
p267_395 We shall not be moved
p267_396 I watch the other visitors
p267_397 I remain a buyer of the shares
p267_398 There were no plans for a rights issue
p267_399 That's all I can say
p267_400 Are they free ?
p267_401 What are they for ?
p267_402 Is there a waiting list ?
p267_403 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p267_404 You thought it was a headache
p267_405 Family liaison officers are now working to support the family
p267_406 I thought he was an animal
p267_407 None of the agencies was able to help
p267_408 We will stand for the nation
p267_409 I'm pleased about one thing
p267_410 In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds
p267_411 The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia
p267_412 My aim is a top six finish
p267_413 Such an attack is bizarre
p267_414 These guys are looking for business
p267_415 He is on the wrong side
p267_416 By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started
p267_417 This is no reflection on Rangers
p267_418 Further new equity was raised in a placing in January
p267_419 It needs to be volatile
p267_420 I've got my own ideas
p267_421 Nobody should believe this story
p268_001 Please call Stella
p268_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p268_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p268_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p268_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p268_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p268_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p268_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p268_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p268_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p268_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p268_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p268_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p268_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p268_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p268_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p268_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p268_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p268_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p268_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p268_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p268_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p268_025 They might have asked, for goodness sake
p268_026 He got very close tonight
p268_027 Smoking is also very important
p268_028 Wages and salaries account for a major proportion of our expenses
p268_029 The first appeared to be successful
p268_030 We must convince the citizens
p268_031 Carlton also declined to comment last night
p268_032 She is employed on short-term contracts
p268_033 Further management changes are planned
p268_034 Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy
p268_035 It's as we were yesterday
p268_036 We are opening an inquiry
p268_037 He works at the airport
p268_038 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p268_039 How are you, sir ?
p268_040 So is that it, then ?
p268_041 Do I have a favourite ?
p268_042 What do we do ?
p268_043 Why do it otherwise ?
p268_044 However, the purchase is as yet unproven
p268_045 Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing
p268_046 Something has to give sometime
p268_047 Her husband had been waiting for her return
p268_048 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p268_049 The latter option was chosen
p268_050 The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager
p268_051 The man became a reporter
p268_052 Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces
p268_053 The thought of playing in the English Premiership has tremendous appeal
p268_054 Among them are many criminals
p268_055 I knew my contract was up this year
p268_056 The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood
p268_057 But it couldn't happen overnight
p268_058 It was just too much for us
p268_059 Perhaps we should do the same
p268_060 They desperately want some stability
p268_061 Everything is possible in football
p268_062 He looks like an Afghan
p268_063 This trend is likely to strengthen
p268_064 Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts
p268_065 He will need that machine
p268_066 Debate was impassioned and furious
p268_067 I would not say that

p268_070 The regional newspapers have outperformed the national titles
p268_071 A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said
p268_072 We deserved the three points
p268_073 The wingers must have felt the cold
p268_074 I am relishing the challenge
p268_075 Let's hope that it does
p268_076 But the organisers refused to worry
p268_077 We have to keep our clients
p268_078 We should be able to cope
p268_079 He also had a Scottish grandfather
p268_080 Autumn is the time of fulfilment
p268_081 George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision
p268_082 But I had never been in a theatre
p268_083 He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it
p268_084 Kenny Miller might come through
p268_085 Scottish football is finally on its way back
p268_086 He's not getting into any games
p268_087 We will pay their bills
p268_088 It is time for new ways for the church
p268_089 It was exactly four months away
p268_090 I am glad I wasn't in it
p268_091 THE Farmer wants a new campaign
p268_092 In fact, I have even had a bet on them
p268_093 Final proposals will be published in February
p268_094 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p268_095 So, did she meet him ?
p268_096 So what is the campaign about ?
p268_097 And does it ?
p268_098 Are you from the rugby ?
p268_099 Had I heard ?
p268_100 What happened in that game ?
p268_101 Are you going to win ?
p268_102 You should try to have a laugh
p268_103 There can be no compromise on welfare
p268_104 He will be kept informed
p268_105 Maybe this battle has been
p268_106 We should keep this recent assault in perspective
p268_107 They do not work for Glasgow City Council
p268_108 Wilson made his remarks on Tuesday
p268_109 Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator
p268_110 Instead, another depression came in
p268_111 Even the one she loved
p268_112 We have thought about doing lots of things
p268_113 England were ahead until two minutes into injury time
p268_114 Well, he is an artist
p268_115 Everything else is a bonus
p268_116 Harrowing is easy, after all
p268_117 Those people must be accountable
p268_118 If they liked it then I'll be happy
p268_119 They would be supported by visiting specialists
p268_120 The ethos of the school was outstanding
p268_121 Or so the story goes
p268_122 Accordingly, financial restructuring is required
p268_123 Others may have, but I'm a fighter
p268_124 We shall rely on human beings
p268_125 McPherson came from United Biscuits
p268_126 On Saturday, it was much the same
p268_127 The Breadwinner came home from Africa
p268_128 Their season has been consigned to history
p268_129 It wasn't possible to relax
p268_130 Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday
p268_131 But then they scored their fourth
p268_132 Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll
p268_133 Monty is great in his own backyard
p268_134 Brown also believes in Walker's innocence
p268_135 That deal will be decided under the existing rules
p268_137 All the employees are redundant
p268_138 Absences should be carefully monitored
p268_139 He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels
p268_140 The rise in retail sales was the first since August
p268_141 Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future
p268_142 The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible
p268_143 It wasn't about her singing, though
p268_144 He was forced to quit
p268_145 What do we want to do that for ?
p268_146 Does the name matter ?
p268_147 how do you get it back ?
p268_148 I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice
p268_149 Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions
p268_150 I was given no instructions by no-one
p268_151 The move follows a review of the Singapore
p268_152 We're not taking any risks
p268_153 It's very dangerous for markets
p268_154 That's what happened against Ayr
p268_155 Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain
p268_156 The following are the principal provisions
p268_157 But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant
p268_158 Before the game we went for a pint
p268_160 We feel very comfortable in this international environment
p268_161 Athletics is on a roll in the country
p268_162 The milk industry is in turmoil
p268_163 He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald
p268_164 And so the cycle continues
p268_165 But the relief was short-lived
p268_166 They exist in name alone
p268_167 YOU cannot blame the turnout
p268_168 We have reacted well to each other
p268_169 There were no plans for a rights issue
p268_170 I can see it now
p268_171 What was the matter for concern ?
p268_172 Do I think about them often ?
p268_173 Is it in the right place ?
p268_174 I will never change our policy on paying appearance money
p268_175 There's still plenty time left
p268_176 Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee
p268_177 The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost
p268_178 We are happy with the referee
p268_179 Emergency services were also on stand-by outside
p268_180 This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service
p268_181 Pressure of work is no excuse
p268_182 Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month
p268_183 The hearing was due to continue today
p268_184 His job was not advertised
p268_185 The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant
p268_186 That was just one night
p268_187 My father died in childbirth
p268_188 They keep the atmosphere in mind
p268_189 Millions of British jobs depend on Europe
p268_190 Sloppy answers are to be avoided
p268_191 That is an entirely unacceptable position
p268_192 This is a frightening development
p268_193 In addition, margins have been maintained
p268_194 Lee Westwood has other ideas
p268_195 The Yugoslav army will still be there
p268_196 Everyone around the club was supportive
p268_197 You've got to be vigilant
p268_198 They have inherited the human rights abusers
p268_199 This Patton will also return
p268_200 But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner
p268_201 You are a gambling man
p268_202 It is all to do with the coaching
p268_203 There was a fine line to tread
p268_204 The refund is fully justified
p268_205 McCarthy said it would look at other means of tackling market abuse
p268_206 We believe a third party was involved
p268_207 I love the spectacle of cinema
p268_208 It would make a lot of sense
p268_209 I think he's the favourite, no question
p268_210 The partnership was set up during the summer
p268_211 Bottling is now the core business
p268_212 People have been wonderful beyond belief
p268_213 I enjoy the creative process
p268_214 Don Hutchison, too, is a threat
p268_215 The whole thing was just unreal
p268_216 The music is therefore profoundly subversive
p268_217 However, this concern appears to be misguided
p268_218 That group reported just before Christmas
p268_219 We had to add value
p268_220 Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes
p268_221 My players have no idea about football
p268_222 Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else
p268_223 It opens the door to the Champions League
p268_224 IT S all change at Kilmarnock
p268_225 So I got a blood test
p268_226 Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director
p268_227 He wants to be competing for titles and medals
p268_228 There's always the next century
p268_229 For businesses, the benefits will be enormous
p268_230 That proved enough to settle the home side down
p268_231 Finding suitable replacements would not be easy
p268_232 Years ago it was really quite simple
p268_233 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p268_234 Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow
p268_235 They've got some extremely good players
p268_236 The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms
p268_237 And they removed a Borderer
p268_238 Does that put pressure on us ?
p268_239 Did it work ?
p268_240 Do you think we are a top nation ?
p268_241 It would seem a natural progression
p268_242 Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement
p268_243 We will turn the corner
p268_244 Of course, it is a tough assignment
p268_245 There was no basis for their arrest
p268_246 This wasn't just a big crowd
p268_247 The best thing for me was to join the Army
p268_248 This is absolutely not true
p268_249 This action reflects a slump in bookings
p268_250 They should stop the bombing
p268_251 These days are long gone
p268_252 I've come here for the jersey
p268_253 The question is whether private investors should follow their example
p268_254 The strong performance is expected to continue
p268_255 Their extinction is not inevitable
p268_256 It's never great to finish second
p268_257 Bin Laden was not mentioned
p268_258 Allen is strong in every shape and form
p268_259 Her political persuasion is no secret
p268_260 We have a budget in March
p268_261 The Dutchman was pleased with the result
p268_262 You had to go and see him
p268_263 The shoppers knew it before City investors did
p268_264 The planning appears to have paid off
p268_265 Further growth will be funded from cash flow
p268_266 We believe in the medium term
p268_267 Bobby Williamson has been brilliant
p268_268 They were never seen again by friends or relatives
p268_269 They could not match it
p268_270 In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience
p268_271 A more exhaustive analysis is in progress
p268_272 I came up through the ranks
p268_273 A warning may be sufficient to reform behaviour
p268_274 Luckily, our patient was stable
p268_275 They made such decisions in London
p268_276 Clearly, they had other problems
p268_277 First, the programme was unbalanced
p268_278 The happiness was slightly misplaced
p268_279 Phase one was a shambles
p268_280 If that's the case, he will struggle
p268_282 A winter of discontent awaits
p268_283 But no party would win overall control of Scotland
p268_284 Injuries have taken their toll
p268_285 Says the Duke of York
p268_286 How independent is that ?
p268_287 What form did that take ?
p268_288 Are they free ?
p268_289 What are they for ?
p268_290 Is there a waiting list ?
p268_291 When she went off it was quite amazing
p268_292 Our destiny is in our own hands
p268_293 The Royal Highland was no exception
p268_294 Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute
p268_295 She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport
p268_296 They need to be involved
p268_297 We've had great things in the past
p268_298 It could be done by experts and lawyers
p268_299 It has been recorded twice
p268_300 Aberdeen had little to offer
p268_301 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p268_302 This youngster is so exciting!
p268_303 I'm interested in interesting work
p268_304 They will probably come back
p268_305 Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender
p268_306 It caused a lot of upset
p268_307 I saw them last week
p268_308 Friday night was a pretty good night
p268_309 This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds
p268_310 You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice
p268_311 In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations
p268_312 Everyone can have their opinion
p268_313 I was inspired by two things
p268_314 It was a lovely sunset
p268_315 Movie stars are public property
p268_316 It comes from reflection or thinking
p268_317 Life has changed for rugby players in just three years
p268_318 Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon
p268_319 The company hopes to repeat the process in France
p268_320 And we have the experience
p268_321 It gave me something to focus on
p268_322 The result is utterly compelling
p268_323 The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday
p268_324 It was his own decision
p268_325 You are a great player
p268_326 I won't make an official complaint
p268_327 British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US
p268_328 It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed
p268_329 It seemed a moving and fitting tribute
p268_330 Drink and petrol prices remain untouched
p268_331 We have an election in eight days
p268_332 Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match
p268_333 Thereafter they were allowed to proceed
p268_334 Walker plans to return indoors
p268_335 It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years
p268_336 The only problem was the greens
p268_337 HARRY Potter has lost his magic
p268_338 The business has expanded rapidly, however
p268_339 Dancing will help his ankles and his feet
p268_340 Twaddle is a case in point
p268_341 We used to live with dignity in our country
p268_342 Plans were made to expand
p268_343 My daughter is an adult
p268_344 Does it matter ?
p268_345 How do you take them away ?
p268_346 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p268_347 After the match, do you ?
p268_348 Have I really come to this ?
p268_349 Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago
p268_350 I am considered a teenager
p268_351 Anyway, the job will be part-time
p268_352 And the World Cup has not even begun
p268_353 Instead, he missed the lot
p268_354 Laura is an investment banker
p268_355 They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters
p268_356 The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Florida in October
p268_357 William Hague delighted his party
p268_358 We played them off the pitch
p268_359 Being captain of this club is fantastic
p268_360 I am not ready for Lennox Lewis
p268_361 McCall is unlikely to change a winning team
p268_362 The statement contained no surprises
p268_363 The performance continues to improve
p268_364 This would include the GM food industry
p268_365 There was an element of frustration
p268_366 We can't give any figures for Edinburgh
p268_367 Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh
p268_368 Weather should not be a factor
p268_369 It didn't matter who was in their way
p268_370 He ended up a headmaster
p268_371 He looked at me before replying
p268_372 I have little time for analysts
p268_373 I have huge respect for him as a journalist
p268_374 That remains the unanswered question
p268_375 He added, We are not prepared for war
p268_376 My wife and family are the support system
p268_377 David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme
p268_378 The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high
p268_379 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p268_380 Those overseas offices were great
p268_381 Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott
p268_382 Six games without defeat is the legacy so far
p268_383 Three weeks later, he resigned
p268_384 Labour will almost certainly remain in control
p268_385 Venus rejects the very suggestion
p268_386 We were beaten by the better team
p268_387 I have received no explanation
p268_388 Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country
p268_389 He also launched a new strategy for the agency
p268_390 And it had two seats
p268_391 This is a load of nonsense
p268_392 Potions said he would drive
p268_393 Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential
p268_394 Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service
p268_395 It is sending the wrong message to people
p268_396 Defensive stocks attracted some interest
p268_397 You can feel at home in China
p268_398 The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest
p268_399 It seems to have worked
p268_400 We have no information on Iraq
p268_401 Either way, the investor retains the premium
p268_402 There is no change in principle from the White Paper
p268_403 We're looking for unity in the council
p268_404 Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed
p268_405 The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee
p268_406 Washington is consumed by the crisis
p268_407 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p268_408 I should think so, too
p268_409 It makes no difference to their friendship
p268_410 It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused
p268_411 The capital costs are modest
p269_001 Please call Stella
p269_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p269_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p269_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p269_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p269_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p269_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p269_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p269_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p269_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p269_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p269_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p269_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p269_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p269_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p269_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p269_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p269_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p269_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p269_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p269_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases
p269_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of the number of bows
p269_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p269_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p269_025 She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning
p269_026 But it failed
p269_027 He said the matter had been neglected in the past
p269_028 In both cases, I suffered a fiasco
p269_029 Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format
p269_030 I have a theory
p269_031 Is this accurate?
p269_032 Because we do not need it
p269_033 He took me on a tour of the wards
p269_034 Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist
p269_035 Help is needed
p269_036 A web site is planned for November
p269_037 It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise
p269_038 Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night
p269_039 That's no bad thing
p269_040 Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack
p269_041 She is believed to be in South Africa
p269_042 I was scared
p269_043 It was ugly
p269_044 There will be no shortage of quality applicants
p269_045 Mexico City was a wonderful experience
p269_046 We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there
p269_047 Who can say?
p269_048 He had no enemies
p269_049 Her body was found about four miles from the car
p269_050 I was inspired by two things
p269_051 Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident
p269_052 It's very odd
p269_053 We have not given up hope
p269_054 This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers
p269_055 New York is expected to come to a standstill
p269_056 We are a grandmother
p269_057 None has ever been found
p269_058 You do not change overnight
p269_059 Art is extra
p269_060 They're appalled by that
p269_061 There was a battle there
p269_062 Scotland had great assets
p269_063 It's that kind of place
p269_064 They are real
p269_065 I've spent a lot of time on buses
p269_066 Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued
p269_067 We have to be sure that the taxation system can work
p269_068 You need a trademark
p269_069 Painful, but only because it's true
p269_070 I was just trying to win the golf tournament
p269_071 It's a winner
p269_072 There could be a way back
p269_073 I was as strong as a horse
p269_074 Both sides have been hit by injury
p269_075 The girls are so lucky to be alive
p269_076 It is a job creation scheme
p269_077 There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement
p269_078 He is now resident in England
p269_079 Even the one she loved
p269_080 People must remain vigilant
p269_081 This is the way things should be handled
p269_082 It is not long term, but I need time to recover
p269_083 I'd like to continue that record
p269_084 That is bound to happen
p269_085 That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog
p269_086 All options are open
p269_087 Someone who cares
p269_088 By then, he was walking on water
p269_089 You will be
p269_090 He put some colour into Scottish history
p269_091 We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead
p269_092 The name on the passport and other details have not been disclosed
p269_093 Today I couldn't run on it
p269_094 They've got to account for it
p269_096 Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished
p269_097 Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights
p269_098 An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks
p269_099 However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full
p269_100 May not have been at fault?
p269_101 We want to get to the final, anyway
p269_102 Oil embargo endorsed
p269_103 But they did not even get a reply to their letter
p269_104 No date has been set for the appeal
p269_105 It's not perfect
p269_106 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p269_107 He pleaded for caution
p269_108 It was quite rigorous
p269_109 I was fighting for my life, I thought
p269_110 I can't even get into the A team
p269_111 The picture is the same across Scotland
p269_112 It was the eighties
p269_113 We have to look at everything before we make any final decision
p269_114 It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option
p269_115 Maybe this battle has been
p269_116 My office is bare
p269_117 Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear
p269_118 This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election
p269_119 It was a delight on every level
p269_121 We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors
p269_122 She has been shot
p269_123 I thought it was a fantastic game
p269_124 Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership
p269_125 I could see his desire for the job in his eyes
p269_126 His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years
p269_127 Next season for every manager is a long time away
p269_128 It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation
p269_129 It's terrible that he has died the same way
p269_130 So the European elections are extremely important
p269_131 Offered the gold medal, he declined
p269_132 Who will attend?
p269_133 Twaddle is a case in point
p269_134 We had a reunion last week
p269_135 The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council
p269_136 The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk
p269_137 It's the big omission
p269_138 If not, a deal could take many months
p269_139 What will happen then?
p269_140 Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general
p269_141 We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties
p269_142 It's a question of fashion
p269_143 He sees a difference in the style of the two teams
p269_144 It seems so long since I did the exams
p269_145 And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life
p269_146 Wallace was a prisoner of war
p269_147 We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football
p269_148 He is severe
p269_149 We just had a go
p269_150 She died at her home
p269_151 We have seen a copy of the report
p269_152 They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide
p269_153 That could mean the difference between life and death in action
p269_154 It's like a football team
p269_155 It would be a last resort
p269_156 That group reported just before Christmas
p269_157 He will emerge as a world leader
p269_158 The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough
p269_159 I was so nervous
p269_160 We want to see the maximum of change
p269_161 Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat
p269_162 His death was a tragic accident
p269_163 This latter point is hugely important
p269_164 It is so unfair
p269_165 It is an attitude of mind
p269_166 I've put my own money into this project
p269_167 They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today
p269_168 I am now unemployed
p269_169 Military action is the only option we have on the table today
p269_170 We have to move forward
p269_171 We knew we had the goal we wanted
p269_172 I lost my head
p269_173 Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland
p269_174 Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board
p269_175 Waiting times for these services are too long
p269_176 They thought they had found a home
p269_177 His team management was protective
p269_179 But the petrol station does not get the benefit
p269_180 It was a great achievement to win at Wembley
p269_181 It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned
p269_182 I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal
p269_183 Everyone can be bought
p269_184 The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate
p269_185 They know no other way
p269_186 It's an idea
p269_187 They will run a mile
p269_188 Four policemen were wounded
p269_189 We did everything by the book
p269_190 Does this matter?
p269_191 My main concern is that public health is not put at risk
p269_193 It had been in place since last July
p269_194 I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react
p269_195 Neither side would reveal the details of the offer
p269_196 We must keep our feet on the ground
p269_197 Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament
p269_198 The bottom line is that we had to get a win
p269_199 The conference is the first test
p269_200 We played them off the pitch
p269_201 He has a lot of experience as captain in his career
p269_202 On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult
p269_203 It was good fun
p269_204 The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster
p269_205 It's all about money, money, money
p269_206 Some realism was needed about time, resources and management
p269_207 I had been at the Evening Standard for two years
p269_208 After that time, the market itself will set the prices
p269_209 But I am a worried man
p269_210 This gives a financial incentive to switch
p269_211 Saddam Hussein is a devil
p269_212 Feel the heat?
p269_213 HARRY Potter has lost his magic
p269_214 We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence
p269_215 I began to pray
p269_216 I am delighted for Simon
p269_217 It had all been arranged
p269_218 A Grampian Police spokesman said
p269_219 I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery
p269_220 The attacker has been put in foster care
p269_221 For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon
p269_222 The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument
p269_223 The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo
p269_224 Who was on the panel?
p269_225 Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E
p269_226 It's so special
p269_227 The loss of a company to the industry is a blow
p269_228 Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval
p269_229 I have spoken to the skipper
p269_230 I'd never seen a play about me
p269_231 It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come
p269_232 My neighbours are horrified
p269_233 But she was
p269_234 It's like a basketball
p269_235 And thought we would get away with it
p269_236 Of course, that is not the whole story
p269_237 Half of young people had had contact with the police
p269_238 Well, they were the unlucky ones
p269_239 The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days
p269_240 It's quite nice
p269_241 On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence
p269_242 A succession of managers in the opera company resigned
p269_243 It would still have been a good film, but very different
p269_244 In fact, it is deeply unpleasant
p269_245 It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet
p269_246 I know I'm in a very special position
p269_247 You can feel at home in China
p269_248 Some families have even requested to leave the city
p269_249 The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery
p269_250 It's a record label, not a form of music
p269_251 I was shocked
p269_252 I should think so, too
p269_253 We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre
p269_254 Her presence was almost everywhere
p269_255 I can't get a job
p269_256 It is nearly there
p269_257 Special measures were needed
p269_258 For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique
p269_259 The distinction is also supported by doctors
p269_260 It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit
p269_261 Kirkwood was arrested
p269_263 I am very angry
p269_264 It is also very valuable
p269_265 This court has made an order which has not been observed
p269_266 The work between the musicians and the fire is very important
p269_267 The warning is timely
p269_268 Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday
p269_269 They want to shut the Scottish Office
p269_270 They are never here
p269_271 The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision
p269_272 On this showing, they should stick with the lads
p269_273 It left me with a sadness
p269_274 Similar measures are expected in England and Wales
p269_275 We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians
p269_276 But, in fact, the reverse is true
p269_277 They wanted the club to make money
p269_278 It's a way of life
p269_279 The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline
p269_280 A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes
p269_281 He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry
p269_282 However, he will have his work cut out defending his title
p269_283 In essence, the teaching profession has a choice
p269_284 In fact, he was talking about the survival business
p269_285 It happens from time to time
p269_286 If not, he should go home
p269_287 They were too hard
p269_288 I saw it at a ruck
p269_289 I intended to look for another club on loan
p269_290 You've got to have both sides
p269_291 What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p269_292 It was a virus
p269_293 Who will perform?
p269_294 It's like a high school play
p269_295 This is a national crisis
p269_296 I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people
p269_297 The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous
p269_298 Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people
p269_299 It shows a contempt by him for the industry
p269_300 It changed my life
p269_301 It's an issue that will have to be tackled
p269_302 Sunday's game was not a trial
p269_303 If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world
p269_304 A new school will be built
p269_305 I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission
p269_306 Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen
p269_307 I was the sheep
p269_308 Graeme was prepared
p269_309 However, the snow was welcomed by some
p269_310 But it's a subtle process
p269_311 The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office
p269_312 There is no openness
p269_313 They are wrong
p269_314 Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday
p269_315 Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school
p269_316 In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge
p269_317 It's just not funny!
p269_318 It is no country for a man or woman of letters
p269_319 They would now be able to look forward with confidence
p269_320 The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn
p269_321 SCOTLAND has shown the way
p269_322 I did not name it
p269_323 The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him
p269_324 We have got no money to go anywhere
p269_325 This wasn't the way it was supposed to be
p269_326 It's about my time as a guitarist
p269_327 I was rubbish
p269_328 We are a peaceful people
p269_329 The election is total confusion and chaos
p269_330 Kids are terrible
p269_331 Henman has been warned
p269_332 Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure
p269_333 The problems began a long time ago
p269_334 Referees are easy targets
p269_335 They had a confession
p269_336 In the old days, it was easy
p269_337 However, the groups denied the claims
p269_338 I came into this world with nothing
p269_339 That's the law of the land
p269_340 There was no time scale
p269_341 It is a strong case
p269_342 Is there a new way forward?
p269_343 They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden
p269_344 The boat was fantastic
p269_345 I'd like to take the plunge
p269_346 Later in the day he was forced to explain his position
p269_347 You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel
p269_348 It's been hard
p269_349 Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal
p269_350 It is a sign of hope
p269_352 It has moved on in the last week
p269_353 That's not eviction because he is not a tenant
p269_354 You feel the pride
p269_355 The train was on time
p269_356 It was so new, so exciting
p269_357 Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector
p269_358 A great deal has been achieved
p269_359 It was forced to divert
p269_360 It should be scrapped
p269_361 It is long gone
p269_362 I HAVE a dream
p269_363 Tyson is overwhelmed
p269_364 As, indeed, they would be
p269_365 But the real problem is the closure of the export market
p269_366 It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage
p269_367 Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors
p269_368 We will be homeless
p269_369 I expected these kind of questions
p269_370 Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported
p269_371 It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives
p269_372 It's a true story
p269_373 All the investment is possible through the public sector
p269_374 He later became a respected High Court judge
p269_375 The play is based on a real-life event
p269_376 He could face a jail sentence
p269_377 The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland
p269_378 They have not done so this season so far
p269_379 I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself
p269_380 They play together perfectly
p269_381 It is a large number
p269_382 He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday
p269_383 They haven't got a hope
p269_384 It is obvious that we are engaged in a war
p269_385 He denied the charge
p269_386 You can cope with it
p269_387 I am very happy with life
p269_388 A young Briton had a lucky escape
p269_389 Treatment is not an issue with these people
p269_391 If you look at the other galleries in this area
p269_392 In Scotland, we keep the faith
p269_393 On the contrary, it was actually very funny
p269_394 I'm pleased about one thing
p269_395 It is unusual
p269_396 We have to pull together, or we will hang apart
p269_397 I suspect the latter
p269_398 Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance
p269_399 Well, it did last time, he was reminded
p269_400 By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started
p269_401 My husband was born in Zimbabwe
p269_402 The car was just there
p269_403 The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today
p270_001 Please call Stella
p270_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p270_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p270_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p270_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p270_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p270_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p270_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p270_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p270_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p270_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p270_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p270_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p270_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p270_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p270_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p270_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p270_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p270_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p270_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p270_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p270_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p270_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p270_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p270_025 He was afraid to stay in hospital in Kosovo
p270_026 They will not be allowed to succeed
p270_027 Smoking is also very important
p270_028 Allan Johnston was not match fit
p270_029 It was as if I had been stabbed
p270_030 He has the courage of the unaware
p270_031 Drugs are a serious problem
p270_032 We have to find a way to put that right
p270_033 That is the face of fear
p270_034 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p270_035 Costs have got to be controlled
p270_036 He really is a lovely man
p270_037 There will be no shortage of quality applicants
p270_038 The staff are as good as any staff in the city
p270_039 This represents a tough game for us
p270_040 The boy is no longer with us
p270_041 Among them are many criminals
p270_042 Merger would be entirely logical
p270_043 Must be prepared to use it
p270_044 Not if you know the person
p270_045 That was the theory, anyway
p270_046 I had come back from London
p270_047 I had trouble with the producers
p270_048 Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer
p270_049 My fitness was very poor
p270_050 He also presented You Bet!
p270_051 What do they want us to do ?
p270_052 Is it worth it ?
p270_053 Does it matter ?
p270_054 How do you take them away ?
p270_055 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p270_056 After the match, do you ?
p270_057 Because we do not need it
p270_058 The outcome of their game isn't the important thing
p270_059 The City welcomed the brighter outlook
p270_060 We have not given up hope
p270_061 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p270_062 We have made a commitment to those people
p270_063 Have a look at our accounts
p270_064 Charles Kennedy had an effective outing
p270_065 Final proposals will be published in February
p270_066 Robin Williams is very subdued
p270_067 It wasn't possible to relax
p270_068 Then followed a bout of flu
p270_069 Both sides have been hit by injury
p270_070 Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom
p270_071 Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator
p270_072 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p270_073 She declined to give the reasons for the decision
p270_074 It is not in my nature
p270_075 My immune system had been depleted
p270_076 It was a unanimous decision
p270_077 It makes for an interesting conference
p270_078 I've had it for the exams
p270_079 I first met him last summer
p270_080 The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office
p270_081 They lived for their children
p270_082 Potions said he would drive
p270_083 The city council is a major property owner in the area
p270_084 Last weekend was extremely frustrating
p270_085 Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll
p270_086 The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation
p270_087 The outsourcing deal will take effect in September
p270_088 The peace process will be buried!
p270_089 They must be on commission
p270_090 He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels
p270_091 Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights
p270_092 We haven't finished the complaints procedure
p270_093 The move follows a review of the Singapore
p270_094 However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full
p270_095 We should recognise that others have done a good job
p270_096 It was some time before she found out he was safe
p270_097 But the battle has only just begun
p270_098 In the end we made too many errors
p270_099 That time is not now, however
p270_100 The following are the principal provisions
p270_101 But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant
p270_102 The new system will be marketed this summer
p270_103 We needed financial backing to get it off the ground
p270_104 I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling
p270_105 I understand the medical concerns
p270_106 The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest
p270_107 Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National
p270_108 We deserve a significant rise
p270_109 I would be prepared to go anywhere
p270_110 You had better believe it
p270_111 The website has changed the company
p270_112 This is a step backwards
p270_113 IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock
p270_114 The situation is not easy, but we will prevail
p270_115 Its replacement was not used in the exercise
p270_116 The problem was a social problem
p270_117 Figures are not relevant to the strategy
p270_118 You were made to feel so welcome
p270_119 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p270_120 You can spend money on housing
p270_121 It's not a quick fix
p270_122 That admission is not surprising
p270_123 Those people must be accountable
p270_124 I've never seen a game like it
p270_125 They keep the atmosphere in mind
p270_126 But we could only help a handful of people
p270_127 Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning
p270_128 Becoming a father was wonderful
p270_129 I was on a roll
p270_130 Are they free ?
p270_131 What are they for ?
p270_132 Is there a waiting list ?
p270_133 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p270_134 So what happens next ?
p270_135 The abuse of elderly people was appalling
p270_136 But beyond a fairly minimal level it has little impact
p270_137 The first half was depressing
p270_138 They made such decisions in London
p270_139 Italy was just behind the US
p270_140 The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday
p270_141 I feel very grateful with everything
p270_142 There was an element of frustration
p270_143 Before it was an ordeal
p270_144 I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood
p270_145 Five minutes later, the home team were back in front
p270_146 Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes
p270_147 Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis
p270_148 No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday
p270_149 We will provide immediate access
p270_150 I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie
p270_151 It is not disputed that the driver was at fault
p270_152 The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday
p270_153 They have not been named
p270_154 The transaction is not feasible
p270_155 It is ambitious, but it can be achieved
p270_156 We will turn the corner
p270_157 My Dad is a hero
p270_158 Do you think we are a top nation ?
p270_159 Is our children learning ?
p270_160 How independent is that ?
p270_161 What form did that take ?
p270_162 They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune
p270_163 There remains an outstanding damages action against the former
p270_164 The woman was his wife
p270_165 This action reflects a slump in bookings
p270_166 Scotland came very close in the second Test
p270_167 We did what we had to do
p270_168 The strong performance is expected to continue
p270_169 She returned to the theatre
p270_170 It's nice to be involved
p270_171 That would open the gates of hell
p270_172 Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo
p270_173 Nobody did in those days
p270_174 There is no signature on this document
p270_175 I would be very keen on a move to Italy
p270_176 They could not match it
p270_177 His team management was protective
p270_178 The jury is still out
p270_179 The outcome is now in our own hands
p270_180 City sentiment is in his favour
p270_181 I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal
p270_182 I'm pretty happy with the way I played
p270_183 Playing in Europe is the benchmark
p270_184 For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo
p270_185 It appears that it was just a genuine mistake
p270_186 They are determined to make a meaningful contribution
p270_187 They receive a high profile in the media
p270_188 That's not fair to the supporters
p270_189 They bought the property four years ago
p270_190 They need to look after themselves
p270_191 Miller was every bit as happy
p270_192 You know the sort of thing
p270_193 They were seriously after him
p270_194 Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval
p270_195 We represent a wide range of society
p270_196 Motorists will buy passes in advance
p270_197 It's very difficult to find a buyer
p270_198 I know every village and island on the west coast
p270_199 Mr Blair was ready for him
p270_200 He should emerge as the winner
p270_201 In France, the reverse is true
p270_202 I came home by ambulance
p270_203 It comes from reflection or thinking
p270_204 They have the cash and the fire power
p270_205 We believe a third party was involved
p270_206 The early physical reports were clear
p270_207 The sisters also became the top two players in the world
p270_208 Stephen has never considered the question of compensation
p270_209 The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday
p270_210 This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill
p270_211 I am very realistic about these things
p270_212 British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US
p270_213 They are looking at a flotation
p270_214 There can be no compromise on that demand
p270_215 Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match
p270_216 It would appear to be a good time to invest
p270_217 HARRY Potter has lost his magic
p270_218 From there, they can go anywhere
p270_219 There is no excuse for domestic abuse
p270_220 It had all been arranged
p270_221 What was the matter for concern ?
p270_222 Do I think about them often ?
p270_223 Is it in the right place ?
p270_224 Did he trip ?
p270_225 Does that put pressure on us ?
p270_226 It was finally agreed on Saturday
p270_227 Basically, they have to come up with the offer
p270_228 They are difficult awards to decide
p270_229 I am considered a teenager
p270_230 There's a chance they might come down
p270_231 Yet the evidence is plain to see
p270_232 There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal
p270_233 I wouldn't even respond to that question
p270_234 People should make their own decisions
p270_235 Investors were also concerned about margin pressure
p270_236 They all made the European Ryder Cup team
p270_237 That was a real challenge
p270_238 His background is firmly in venture capital
p270_239 The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions
p270_240 We were a shambles at the back
p270_241 The scientific debate is dead
p270_242 They are the innocent victims
p270_243 You should always be able to get out in some direction
p270_244 Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh
p270_245 This would include the GM food industry
p270_246 And he goes with it
p270_247 It had so much to do with output
p270_248 Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families
p270_249 That will be a decision for BBC Scotland
p270_250 The irony was not lost
p270_251 I might get an injury very easily
p270_252 It might be sad, but it's a fact
p270_253 Everything depends on the weather
p270_254 This is a historic occasion
p270_255 This championship is different from the other majors
p270_256 Labour was too busy to respond
p270_257 I was just getting over the time difference
p270_258 I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record
p270_259 Either way, the investor retains the premium
p270_260 There is no change in principle from the White Paper
p270_261 You're not getting any goodwill
p270_262 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p270_263 No production contract is yet in sight
p270_264 Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland
p270_265 A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe
p270_266 We accept the new rules
p270_267 It is probably in the culture
p270_268 He took over our lives
p270_269 I'd never run for them
p270_270 how do you get it back ?
p270_271 What are you not good at ?
p270_272 I think, therefore I am ?
p270_273 Who was she ?
p270_274 Or was it ?
p270_275 And they were being paid ?
p270_276 These figures are truly terrible
p270_277 The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high
p270_278 He could see no other bidder
p270_279 There's not much money in cycling
p270_280 None of this work is guaranteed
p270_281 This could put pressure on UK inflation
p270_282 Any error is severely punished
p270_283 Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate
p270_284 I understand the security issue
p270_285 It left me with a sadness
p270_286 Similar measures are expected in England and Wales
p270_287 The target is to break even by Christmas
p270_288 It was never a free kick
p270_289 The manager's position was obviously included in that review
p270_290 It involved the same people
p270_291 She has fallen in love with Scotland, however
p270_292 You have to expect this type of thing
p270_293 There's always the next century
p270_294 It's hard to see it
p270_295 The partnership was set up during the summer
p270_296 Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles
p270_297 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p270_298 I intended to look for another club on loan
p270_299 Maloney is an engaging talent
p270_300 We would hope to make progress on that next year
p270_301 The rescue package is public money
p270_302 He was overwhelmed by the response
p270_303 The effect was almost magical
p270_304 It would be great to win the title again
p270_305 It could well be military
p270_306 Selection is not in my hands at all
p270_307 His day had started much like any other Sunday
p270_308 The songs are just so good
p270_309 Sunday's game was not a trial
p270_310 Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear
p270_311 The world record is suspicious
p270_312 There was no hint of scandal
p270_313 I was brought up in a mining background
p270_314 Job losses were also announced
p270_315 A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election
p270_316 It is a road of death
p270_317 The pound has also suffered
p270_318 He has left the company
p270_319 What happened in that game ?
p270_320 Are you going to win ?
p270_321 Was it the wife ?
p270_322 Why change it ?
p270_323 What do we want to do that for ?
p270_324 Does the name matter ?
p270_325 People can really get themselves in a mess
p270_326 Survival is not an option
p270_327 There will be good prospects ahead
p270_328 Will have consequences for Scottish universities
p270_329 It is a court case
p270_330 This isn't the end of story
p270_331 It will set the tone
p270_332 He will go a long way
p270_333 It is far too early
p270_334 The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached
p270_335 The Premier League has been a huge success
p270_336 Age is not like other forms of discrimination
p270_337 The next week is crucial
p270_338 Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure
p270_339 My body is clearly capable
p270_340 It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive
p270_341 There was some merit in that
p270_342 They were impressive against France
p270_343 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p270_344 So, did she meet him ?
p270_345 So what is the campaign about ?
p270_346 And does it ?
p270_347 Are you from the rugby ?
p270_348 He declined to comment on possible disposals
p270_349 Nobody said it was required
p270_350 This statement has never been withdrawn
p270_351 It was tough to contain the excitement
p270_352 Whether this return was too soon
p270_353 Last night, he pledged to clear his name
p270_354 There is a good example in this city
p270_355 It's wonderful to have won
p270_356 He was at school in Devon
p270_357 This decision is a farce
p270_358 My view has now completely changed
p270_359 Finally, he paid for the movie
p270_360 We are satisfied with this outcome
p270_361 We have very limited capacity
p270_362 Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side
p270_363 An alternative must be offered
p270_364 The value of the merger is still there
p270_365 Nobody else was with me
p270_366 My mind is focused on the next four weeks
p270_367 We lost our composure towards the interval, he said
p270_368 But the Foreign Secretary can cope
p270_369 He was then replaced by Ross
p270_370 But BA said the prediction was premature
p270_371 You need a licence to run a pub
p270_372 The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year
p270_373 I came here this week to work
p270_374 They knew that I wanted to do something
p270_375 Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months
p270_376 He must have seen the movie
p270_377 This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst
p270_378 She said they would appeal
p270_379 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p270_380 How are you, sir ?
p270_381 So is that it, then ?
p270_382 What do we do ?
p270_383 They were to blame for the first two goals
p270_384 Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited
p270_385 Here is a weather forecast for the weekend
p270_386 She is obviously very disappointed
p270_387 In addition, it was in breach of natural justice
p270_388 Last season was very hard for me
p270_389 The parties include the Scottish Executive
p270_390 Tomorrow will be a different game entirely
p270_391 Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors
p270_392 I always knew she was funny
p270_393 Glasgow University declined to comment
p270_394 It runs until the beginning of June
p270_395 It sounds like a wish list
p270_396 They have not got anyone
p270_397 It has happened for generations
p270_398 There was a substantial explosion
p270_399 Petrol prices were widely blamed
p270_400 The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account
p270_401 I was conceived in Aberdeen
p270_402 Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world
p270_403 There's still no-one like him
p270_404 He put some colour into Scottish history
p270_405 Ferguson must take the blame
p270_406 It's too close to call
p270_407 The breakdown was much later in her life
p270_408 Of course, it is nonsense
p270_409 Colour was at the core of his life
p270_410 We must improve our relations with government
p270_411 That is the ultimate revenge
p270_412 In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations
p270_413 A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire
p270_414 Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning
p270_415 Shelter also supports the reform
p270_416 This market has been neglected by the whisky industry
p270_417 That was a touch of class
p270_418 People will see this over time
p270_419 Surrey police said no body had been found
p270_420 The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia
p270_421 My aim is a top six finish
p270_422 Such an attack is bizarre
p270_423 If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help
p270_424 This is a huge boost for my confidence
p270_425 It was a breathtaking moment
p270_426 It needs to be volatile
p270_427 The need for any new UN resolutions will be put on hold
p270_428 The woman is basically off her head
p270_429 I never won a penny throughout my career
p270_430 Thomson is expected to manage the business
p270_431 The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups
p270_432 In fact, the reasons are simple
p270_433 We know about the crisis in cattle
p270_434 The British government does not want to know
p270_435 It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes
p270_436 I didn't get to keep it
p270_437 Their condition is described as satisfactory
p270_438 It would be very dangerous
p270_439 Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra
p270_440 The villagers were shot in the head at short range
p270_441 It is not over by any means
p270_442 It deserved to be a winner
p270_443 They are interior designers and architects
p270_444 It shows the right amount of progress
p270_445 I think the goalkeeper should have gone
p270_446 They had learned from the lessons of the first game
p270_447 It was to be inclusive
p270_448 No further details of expansion plans were given
p270_449 The budget was too low for that
p270_450 Our legal advice is clear
p270_451 Striking the deal has come as a big relief
p270_452 A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing
p270_453 They were good years for him
p270_454 Let that be their memorial
p270_455 This is the stuff of live music
p270_456 We expect a rise by the end of the second quarter
p270_457 We will deal with the refugees
p270_458 If that's the case, he will struggle
p270_459 We are over the moon
p270_460 They're just a good retailer
p270_461 We are now up against it
p270_462 Something happened on that island
p273_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p273_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p273_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p273_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p273_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p273_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p273_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, and its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p273_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p273_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p273_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p273_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p273_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p273_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p273_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p273_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p273_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p273_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p273_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p273_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p273_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p273_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p273_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p273_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p273_025 A shortlist is to be drawn up next month
p273_026 It was as if I had been stabbed
p273_027 Because we do not need it
p273_028 It is about control of our economy
p273_029 Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy
p273_030 It is a tough game but we have a chance
p273_031 I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah
p273_032 It carries a double message
p273_033 That is the face of fear
p273_034 The staff are as good as any staff in the city
p273_035 Among them are many criminals
p273_036 This will save interest charges
p273_037 Every aspect of our play was first class
p273_038 He looks like an Afghan
p273_039 Everything else is a bonus
p273_040 People want to see me on the screen
p273_041 Her body was found about four miles from the car
p273_042 I was inspired by two things
p273_043 Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer
p273_044 My fitness was very poor
p273_045 We have to look beyond the very short term
p273_046 The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse
p273_047 I expect a rapid response
p273_048 I must take a seat
p273_049 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p273_050 How are you, sir ?
p273_051 So is that it, then ?
p273_052 Do I have a favourite ?
p273_053 What do we do ?
p273_054 The situation is not easy, but we will prevail
p273_055 Let's hope that it does
p273_056 We have to keep our clients
p273_057 Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London
p273_058 We will pay their bills
p273_059 It was exactly four months away
p273_060 Charles Kennedy had an effective outing
p273_061 I was conceived in Aberdeen
p273_062 Robin Williams is very subdued
p273_063 The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous
p273_064 I was as strong as a horse
p273_065 We should keep this recent assault in perspective
p273_066 They do not work for Glasgow City Council
p273_067 Both sides have been hit by injury
p273_068 The creditors have lost a lot
p273_069 Stephen has never considered the question of compensation
p273_070 Even the one she loved
p273_071 Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat
p273_072 After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction
p273_073 It makes for an interesting conference
p273_074 This view was echoed by another Scottish analyst
p273_075 No progress has been made
p273_076 He has been a success this year
p273_077 They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life
p273_078 We have to offer value for money
p273_079 That should be the subject matter of a public debate
p273_080 It's so hard to shift
p273_081 They lived for their children
p273_082 Potions said he would drive
p273_083 Last weekend was extremely frustrating
p273_084 He had missed a penalty against the English
p273_085 The allegations were still under investigation, he added
p273_086 I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party
p273_087 He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels
p273_088 It was clear on Thursday
p273_089 It was a family tragedy
p273_090 It's not a holiday time for football players
p273_091 They like being on the front pages of the newspapers
p273_092 He was prepared for this
p273_093 Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us
p273_094 We haven't finished the complaints procedure
p273_095 We intend to change the model
p273_096 We should recognise that others have done a good job
p273_097 But the battle has only just begun
p273_098 The following are the principal provisions
p273_099 Before the game we went for a pint
p273_100 Athletics is on a roll in the country
p273_101 I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling
p273_102 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p273_103 We deserve a significant rise
p273_104 Got to win today, though
p273_105 The pressure is on them
p273_106 New Year will be very busy
p273_107 There's still plenty of time left
p273_108 I didn't think so either
p273_109 He thought she was amazing
p273_110 I came here this week to work
p273_111 Then again, we could have
p273_112 Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month
p273_113 Here, again, they were denied a voice
p273_114 We would make a start
p273_115 His job was not advertised
p273_116 This is a frightening development
p273_117 Which can happen any time
p273_118 That is far too high
p273_119 My life has changed a lot
p273_120 Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland
p273_121 That would open the gates of hell
p273_122 You are a gambling man
p273_123 It feels like a privilege
p273_124 That is the ultimate revenge
p273_125 I am totally devoted to this job
p273_126 We'll have to think about it
p273_127 I love the spectacle of cinema
p273_128 The findings are published in the British Journal of Cancer
p273_129 I'm so grateful for that
p273_130 The study is expected to last until the middle of the year
p273_131 There's always the next century
p273_132 There's only one team in Ayrshire
p273_133 The weather forecast isn't good
p273_134 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p273_135 Behind him was his brother
p273_136 She had gone to the Catholic school
p273_137 One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas
p273_138 It would seem a natural progression
p273_139 It was a terrible combination of factors
p273_140 Today is not a victory
p273_141 Why do it otherwise ?
p273_142 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p273_143 So, did she meet him ?
p273_144 So what is the campaign about ?
p273_145 And does it ?
p273_146 Are you from the rugby ?
p273_147 Had I heard ?
p273_148 This action reflects a slump in bookings
p273_149 They should stop the bombing
p273_150 The Internet is no substitute for customer service
p273_151 I'm not going to answer that right now
p273_152 It's never great to finish second
p273_153 The long-term trend is certainly moving towards a balance
p273_154 Further growth will be funded from cash flow
p273_155 They could not match it
p273_156 I always felt they played for me
p273_157 His team management was protective
p273_158 One season, they might do well
p273_159 The jury is still out
p273_160 Phase one was a shambles
p273_161 I did not have a bet on myself
p273_162 It is also very valuable
p273_163 For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo
p273_164 They are determined to make a meaningful contribution
p273_165 Says the Duke of York
p273_166 They bought the property four years ago
p273_167 Hopefully, it will bring new customers
p273_168 DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush
p273_169 You know the sort of thing
p273_170 It was a bit like having children
p273_171 It shows the strength of the roots
p273_172 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p273_173 This youngster is so exciting!
p273_174 Two years later, she was dead
p273_175 It's very difficult to find a buyer
p273_176 Neither side would reveal the details of the offer
p273_177 Everyone can have their opinion
p273_178 Because he was born in England
p273_179 I came home by ambulance
p273_180 What happened in that game ?
p273_181 Are you going to win ?
p273_182 Was it the wife ?
p273_183 Why change it ?
p273_184 What do we want to do that for ?
p273_185 We've had an enjoyable adventure
p273_186 It comes from reflection or thinking
p273_187 It was a moment of madness
p273_188 They have the cash and the fire power
p273_189 The company hopes to repeat the process in France
p273_190 The early physical reports were clear
p273_191 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p273_192 The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday
p273_193 It gave no further details
p273_194 Little is known about them
p273_195 I won't make an official complaint
p273_196 British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US
p273_197 It was worth a photograph
p273_198 Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match
p273_199 His injury was completely random
p273_200 HARRY Potter has lost his magic
p273_201 From there, they can go anywhere
p273_202 I'm just a regular person
p273_203 It had all been arranged
p273_204 The statement contained no surprises
p273_205 His third goal was superb
p273_206 It will affect their work
p273_207 I am considered a teenager
p273_208 IT S all change at Kilmarnock
p273_209 There's a chance they might come down
p273_210 The transaction is not feasible
p273_211 He remains a main board director of Royal
p273_212 The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo
p273_213 Investors were also concerned about margin pressure
p273_214 He later paid a tribute to his opponent
p273_216 The cuts were made within an hour of each other
p273_217 William Hague delighted his party
p273_218 You could feel the heat
p273_219 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p273_220 I have spoken to the skipper
p273_221 That was a problem for me
p273_222 The output price index in December was unchanged on November
p273_223 They would have to go to the Royal
p273_224 But he failed to win the committee's support
p273_225 He is obviously very dangerous
p273_226 It depends on Labour, not on us
p273_227 It had so much to do with the output
p273_228 We have not been approached
p273_229 The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high
p273_230 I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight
p273_231 That will be a decision for BBC Scotland
p273_232 Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning
p273_233 Will have consequences for Scottish universities

p273_236 My future is in the marathon
p273_237 Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise
p273_238 We were well worth the win
p273_239 Kingfisher can afford to wait
p273_240 In fact, it is deeply unpleasant
p273_241 Defensive stocks attracted some interest
p273_242 You can feel at home in China
p273_243 Does the name matter ?
p273_244 how do you get it back ?
p273_245 What are you not good at ?
p273_246 I think, therefore I am ?
p273_247 Who was she ?
p273_248 I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record
p273_249 We have no information on Iraq
p273_250 Paterson can afford to be generous
p273_251 Washington is consumed by the crisis
p273_252 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p273_253 It makes no difference to their friendship
p273_254 No production contract is yet in sight
p273_255 It was the climax of the thing
p273_256 We accept the new rules
p273_257 On the contrary they stand to gain
p273_258 It was a minor incident
p273_259 Blair is very positive at European Councils
p273_260 He took over our lives
p273_261 I rejected the idea of a separate residence
p273_262 I'd never run for them
p273_263 Her body has never been found
p273_264 This will look at consumer attitudes
p273_265 He could see no other bidder
p273_266 There's not much money in cycling
p273_267 The demand is created by the supply
p273_268 We're trying to get rounded performers
p273_269 Any error is severely punished
p273_270 Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK
p273_271 Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate
p273_272 It was a horrible moment
p273_273 Truth is the child of time
p273_274 It was an easy decision to come here
p273_275 Similar measures are expected in England and Wales
p273_276 Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years
p273_277 It was never a free kick
p273_278 They failed to reach agreement yesterday
p273_279 This is a great opportunity for us
p273_280 We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service
p273_281 She has fallen in love with Scotland, however
p273_282 You have to expect this type of thing
p273_283 In essence, the teaching profession has a choice
p273_284 It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday
p273_285 Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles
p273_286 The response from everyone was wonderful
p273_287 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p273_288 The circumstances have changed since last year
p273_289 It's all designed to speed up the service
p273_290 We feel very comfortable in this international environment
p273_291 Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure
p273_292 Tony Blair said as little
p273_293 And they were being paid ?
p273_294 was everything done to save the people ?
p273_295 What was the matter for concern ?
p273_296 Do I think about them often ?
p273_297 Is it in the right place ?
p273_298 The rescue package is public money
p273_299 The effect was almost magical
p273_300 I will never change our policy on paying appearance money
p273_301 And that culture is everywhere In Dublin
p273_302 Holland won by five wickets
p273_303 His appeal is instantly understood
p273_304 The songs are just so good
p273_305 I can hardly believe it
p273_306 Saturday's match was fairly straightforward
p273_307 Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear
p273_308 The world record is suspicious
p273_309 I was brought up in a mining background
p273_310 I thought his speech was a disgrace
p273_311 Job losses were also announced
p273_312 I had no intention of misleading anyone
p273_313 The pound has also suffered
p273_314 Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well
p273_316 Scotland has shown the way
p273_317 You are talking about a matter of life and death
p273_318 Leading share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt
p273_319 The letters are going out today
p273_320 He will go a long way
p273_321 We will listen to any suggestion
p273_322 But it is a slow process
p273_323 The woman is basically off her head
p273_324 Mr Clinton was asked about his memory
p273_325 It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive
p273_326 Other musicians were found in retirement
p273_327 It is a terrible state of affairs
p273_328 Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis
p273_329 That is a trend which will be encouraged
p273_330 They will have to cut through the roof
p273_331 The airport was even different
p273_332 Hopefully, he will get a lucky break
p273_333 He declined to comment on possible disposals
p273_334 Nobody said it was required
p273_335 It was tough to contain the excitement
p273_336 Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow
p273_337 Whether this return was too soon
p273_338 Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items
p273_339 It's wonderful to have won
p273_340 He was at school in Devon
p273_341 Many of these properties are located in the south of England
p273_342 I'd like to take the plunge
p273_343 I have a moral dilemma
p273_344 My view has now completely changed
p273_345 There was a definite prejudice
p273_346 The strong pound also took its toll
p273_347 We have very limited capacity
p273_348 Everything in golf is a balance
p273_349 He can handle it without any problem
p273_350 The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper
p273_351 The Allies intend to maintain the average
p273_352 My mind is focused on the next four weeks
p273_353 We're still the only ones in the High Street
p273_354 He had no previous convictions
p273_355 But the Foreign Secretary can cope
p273_356 I was delighted to accept
p273_357 Do you think we are a top nation ?
p273_358 How independent is that ?
p273_359 Are they free ?
p273_360 Is there a waiting list ?
p273_361 George Mitchell is trying to close the gap
p273_362 But BA said the prediction was premature
p273_363 They should take their mobile phones
p273_364 They have broken that promise
p273_365 That is a crazy situation
p273_366 We are really good friends
p273_367 From our point of view, the player is free to leave
p273_368 Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months
p273_369 The statement finally came on Wednesday night after the market had closed
p273_370 The salary changes are long overdue
p273_371 The major championships will always have a special place
p273_372 They were to blame for the first two goals
p273_373 There is no deal as yet
p273_374 Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited
p273_375 This hasn't happened in a vacuum
p273_376 It was like a weekly wage
p273_377 In due course the deal was done
p273_378 to have products for their needs
p273_379 The pair are very much in love
p273_380 We will win the argument
p273_381 The prosecution say the girl was the only witness to the attack
p273_382 It benefits the whole family
p273_383 Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors
p273_384 It runs until the beginning of June
p273_385 Theatre is not a museum
p273_386 The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account
p273_387 We are satisfied with this outcome
p273_388 We operate as a Scottish company
p273_389 They have not done so this season so far
p273_390 Rugby is a hard game
p273_391 Is it worth it ?
p273_392 Does it matter ?
p273_393 How do you take them away ?
p273_394 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p273_395 After the match, do you ?
p273_396 He put some colour into Scottish history
p273_397 This big issue is whether it can be enforced
p273_398 The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland
p273_399 Clark is back on top form
p273_400 The results will take second place
p273_401 It was a funny game
p273_402 It's too close to call
p273_403 It is a large number
p273_404 She started to put on weight
p273_405 I've had a wonderful career
p273_406 Upgrading the station has been under consideration for some time
p273_407 But the foundations have been laid
p273_408 There was an element of frustration
p273_409 Russell is delighted with them
p273_410 We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre
p273_411 We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow
p273_412 George is on a two-day visit to Scotland
p273_413 I remain a buyer of the shares
p273_414 I would like to continue to develop
p273_415 Family liaison officers are now working to support the family
p273_416 This market has been neglected by the whisky industry
p273_417 There is a solution, she believes
p273_418 That might mean another delay
p273_419 That's been all around Europe with me
p273_420 She's had to suffer for the last six years
p273_421 The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia
p273_422 My aim is a top six finish
p273_423 That means that nobody can do it
p273_424 Such an attack is bizarre
p273_425 At half-time he was presented to both teams
p273_426 No date has been fixed for his return
p273_427 It was a breathtaking moment
p273_428 Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt
p273_429 A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed
p273_430 No-one wanted to run it tonight
p273_431 They are not left wing
p273_432 It is not a standing army
p273_433 Strangely enough I felt very sharp
p273_434 The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment
p273_435 Their condition is described as satisfactory
p273_436 He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review
p274_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p274_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p274_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p274_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p274_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p274_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p274_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p274_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p274_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p274_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p274_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways
p274_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p274_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p274_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p274_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p274_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p274_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p274_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p274_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p274_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p274_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p274_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p274_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p274_025 I can't play the game for them
p274_026 She is employed on short-term contracts
p274_027 Drugs are a serious problem
p274_028 This is a central issue
p274_029 Not if you know the person
p274_030 Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy
p274_031 Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism
p274_032 Costs have got to be controlled
p274_033 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p274_034 Several investments have already been made
p274_035 This represents a tough game for us
p274_036 The boy is no longer with us
p274_037 They said she was stable
p274_038 Among them are many criminals
p274_039 Merger would be entirely logical
p274_040 Well, he is an artist
p274_041 He looks like an Afghan
p274_042 Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts
p274_043 He will need that machine
p274_044 People want to see me on the screen
p274_045 I had come back from London
p274_046 Pulled a huge number of viewers
p274_047 I had trouble with the producers
p274_048 Subsidy income will not be affected
p274_049 We are certainly talking about many millions
p274_050 The outcome of their game isn't the important thing
p274_051 The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse
p274_052 The latter were not from Scotland
p274_053 We felt it was sufficient
p274_054 There's still plenty time left
p274_055 The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow
p274_056 Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London
p274_057 He's not getting into any games
p274_058 We will pay their bills
p274_059 Charles Kennedy had an effective outing
p274_060 He hadn't had them for a long time
p274_061 Only water is currently allowed
p274_062 It's not covered by the insurance
p274_063 We need to increase the membership
p274_064 There could be a way back
p274_065 Then followed a bout of flu
p274_066 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?)
p274_067 How are you, sir ?)
p274_068 So is that it, then ?)
p274_069 Do I have a favourite ?)
p274_070 What do we do ?)
p274_071 Why do it otherwise ?)
p274_072 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?)
p274_073 Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator
p274_074 I want the Commonwealth and European titles
p274_075 Talk of a crisis is absurd
p274_076 After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction
p274_077 There may be reasons for it
p274_078 I first met him last summer
p274_079 It is the only company of its kind in the UK
p274_080 The ethos of the school was outstanding
p274_081 It took an option on the process
p274_082 We have to offer value for money
p274_083 Our mother is very worried
p274_084 They lived for their children
p274_085 It wasn't possible to relax
p274_086 This is a complex and detailed report
p274_087 Tony Blair said as little
p274_088 The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation
p274_089 The processing plant was closed yesterday
p274_090 I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party
p274_091 That will bring about a dramatic improvement
p274_092 It was clear on Thursday
p274_093 It was a family tragedy
p274_094 He is not a dancer
p274_095 It is for policy Ministers to defend their policies
p274_096 In the end we made too many errors
p274_097 The following are the principal provisions
p274_098 I did not concentrate on my performance
p274_099 But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant
p274_100 Before the game we went for a pint
p274_101 Our house was very small
p274_102 I did not think about the Ryder Cup
p274_103 I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling
p274_104 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p274_105 According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland
p274_106 Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National
p274_107 We deserve a significant rise
p274_108 Here the jury is still out
p274_109 This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service
p274_110 We have a team to reach the final
p274_111 You can spend money on housing
p274_112 It's not a quick fix
p274_113 Structural changes were also required
p274_114 It was a good game to watch
p274_115 However, the problem is the timing
p274_116 Which can happen any time
p274_117 We had another last Tuesday
p274_118 This should begin in October
p274_119 I was on a roll
p274_120 There is no evidence that these people are helpful
p274_121 That is far too high
p274_122 He said to give a local injection
p274_123 What happened in that game ?)
p274_124 Are you going to win ?)
p274_125 Was it the wife ?)
p274_126 Why change it ?)
p274_127 What do we want to do that for ?)
p274_128 Does the name matter ?)
p274_129 how do you get it back ?)
p274_130 That would open the gates of hell
p274_131 The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday
p274_132 I feel very grateful with everything
p274_133 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p274_134 This is a major championship
p274_135 I love the spectacle of cinema
p274_136 This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely
p274_137 It's going to take some time
p274_138 I think he's the favourite, no question
p274_139 It is a vicious circle
p274_140 The BBC was a disgrace
p274_141 But she was very human
p274_142 The referee faces a massive job
p274_143 Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis
p274_144 There is no mandate for a regime change
p274_145 No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday
p274_146 The whole industry is a shambles
p274_147 We have to speed up the process
p274_148 There's only one team in Ayrshire
p274_149 I prefer the clarity of the existing system
p274_150 The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms
p274_151 It is ambitious, but it can be achieved
p274_152 It was by the numbers
p274_153 And sooner than we may think
p274_154 The abuse of elderly people was appalling
p274_155 The danger is always there
p274_156 Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics
p274_157 They should stop the bombing
p274_158 Scotland came very close in the second Test
p274_159 Full back was a bit of the unknown
p274_160 The strong performance is expected to continue
p274_161 He was in great spirits
p274_162 We came across the first set of bodies
p274_163 Overall, the labour market continued to tighten
p274_164 But it is different in different regions
p274_165 Further growth will be funded from cash flow
p274_166 They had been forced to walk
p274_167 The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups
p274_168 It's not good at all
p274_169 You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions
p274_170 But the petrol station does not get the benefit
p274_171 If that's the case, he will struggle
p274_173 I'm just going to hit the shot
p274_174 Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked
p274_175 They are determined to make a meaningful contribution
p274_176 Says the Duke of York
p274_177 And they were being paid ?)
p274_178 was everything done to save people ?)
p274_179 What was the matter for concern ?)
p274_180 Do I think about them often ?)
p274_181 Is it in the right place ?)
p274_182 Did he trip ?)
p274_183 They bought the property four years ago
p274_184 Miller was every bit as happy
p274_185 Women were mostly notable by their absence
p274_186 They responded well after the run of defeats
p274_187 It could be done by experts and lawyers
p274_188 The interim dividend has been passed
p274_189 But there's an upturn in the sector
p274_190 Aberdeen had little to offer
p274_191 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p274_192 I'm interested in interesting work
p274_193 We represent a wide range of society
p274_194 Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender
p274_195 It's very difficult to find a buyer
p274_196 Neither side would reveal the details of the offer
p274_197 But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner
p274_198 Everyone can have their opinion
p274_199 He should emerge as the winner
p274_200 It comes from reflection or thinking
p274_201 That might mean another delay
p274_202 The early physical reports were clear
p274_203 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p274_204 The result is utterly compelling
p274_205 The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office
p274_206 I won't make an official complaint
p274_207 It was worth a photograph
p274_208 Which isn't a bad idea
p274_209 We have an election in eight days
p274_210 Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match
p274_211 They have known the hard times
p274_212 Today we must not repeat that mistake
p274_213 It's easy to be negative about these things
p274_214 Basically, they have to come up with the offer
p274_215 I am considered a teenager
p274_216 However, Dundee deserved to win this game
p274_217 That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic
p274_218 It was a crazy day
p274_219 People should make their own decisions
p274_220 The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo
p274_221 The red card was okay
p274_222 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p274_223 Laura is an investment banker
p274_224 We have not given up hope
p274_225 Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray
p274_226 William Hague delighted his party
p274_227 We played them off the pitch
p274_228 The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions
p274_229 The output price index in December was unchanged on November
p274_230 The performance continues to improve
p274_231 A small number of new jobs will also be created
p274_232 They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house
p274_233 He does not much like the Liberal Democrats
p274_234 It depends on Labour, not on us
p274_235 Paterson can afford to be generous
p274_236 Wilson will tell the truth
p274_237 The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high
p274_238 Customers would then be consulted over any changes
p274_239 Those overseas offices were great
p274_240 You will have seen the adverts
p274_241 Half of young people had had contact with the police
p274_242 It will now be revived
p274_243 I was released after six days
p274_244 Three weeks later, he resigned
p274_245 Others agreed with this view
p274_246 I was just a kid
p274_247 There were no reports of casualties
p274_248 Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter
p274_249 The effects are not all bad
p274_250 He would not impose a fine
p274_251 Does that put pressure on us ?)
p274_252 Did it work ?)
p274_253 Do you think we are a top nation ?)
p274_254 Is our children learning ?)
p274_255 How independent is that ?)
p274_256 What form did that take ?)
p274_257 Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise
p274_258 Kingfisher can afford to wait
p274_259 A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe
p274_260 Labour was too busy to respond
p274_261 You can feel at home in China
p274_262 He will go a long way
p274_263 We have no information on Iraq
p274_264 Either way, the investor retains the premium
p274_266 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p274_267 I should think so, too
p274_268 This will save interest charges
p274_269 No production contract is yet in sight
p274_270 Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland
p274_271 He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen
p274_272 This idea has been around for four years
p274_273 The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow
p274_274 We accept the new rules
p274_275 He is quite well organised
p274_276 I couldn't honestly tell you
p274_277 On the contrary they stand to gain
p274_278 Quality was high in all sections
p274_279 He took over our lives
p274_280 I rejected the idea of a separate residence
p274_281 This will look at consumer attitudes
p274_282 It is also very valuable
p274_283 There's not much money in cycling
p274_284 My main intention was to write a funny comedy
p274_285 None of this work is guaranteed
p274_286 Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention
p274_287 It has raised the profile of Scottish banking
p274_288 They can leave at any time
p274_289 It opens the door to the Champions League
p274_290 It has the potential to be another North Sea
p274_291 Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate
p274_292 Frankly, we should all have such problems
p274_293 And Michael was just great
p274_294 Strikers like to go to the ground
p274_295 This is a great opportunity for us
p274_296 We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service
p274_297 It's called the Supreme Court for a reason
p274_298 You have to expect this type of thing
p274_299 It is a flexible concept
p274_300 The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened
p274_301 And we were very lucky
p274_302 So the Government will be damaged
p274_303 The partnership was set up during the summer
p274_304 There's nothing I can say
p274_305 Her body was found on Monday morning
p274_306 We will deliver at director level
p274_307 They have shown a great desire and attitude
p274_308 I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh
p274_309 Maloney is an engaging talent
p274_310 The rescue package is public money
p274_311 Clydesdale Bank declined to comment
p274_312 Everything in golf is a balance
p274_313 The weather will be unpredictable if anything
p274_314 His appeal is instantly understood
p274_315 The songs are just so good
p274_316 Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme
p274_317 Saturday's match was fairly straightforward
p274_318 Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear
p274_319 McNaughton was not so sure
p274_320 Are they free ?)
p274_321 What are they for ?)
p274_322 Is there a waiting list ?)
p274_323 Do they think anyone else wants them ?)
p274_324 So what happens next ?)
p274_325 Had this been common practice ?)
p274_326 What do they want us to do ?)
p274_327 Is it worth it ?)
p274_328 There was no hint of scandal
p274_329 I was brought up in a mining background
p274_330 We're not an employment agency
p274_331 She had gone to the Catholic school
p274_332 But I have been told that rugby playing numbers are up again
p274_333 The group is not paying a dividend
p274_334 Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well
p274_335 He has left the company
p274_336 And he goes with it
p274_337 There will be good prospects ahead
p274_338 It is a court case
p274_339 There is a handful of rewarding paintings
p274_340 This is a historic occasion
p274_341 Writing has diminished in value
p274_342 That's the way it goes
p274_343 After some discussion they did
p274_344 No one wants a dispute
p274_345 Our season is not finished
p274_346 Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed
p274_347 The business model is actually very exciting
p274_348 There was some merit in that
p274_349 That is a trend which will be encouraged
p274_350 Other people had looked at it
p274_351 He declined to comment on possible disposals
p274_352 It was tough to contain the excitement
p274_353 Either team will be hard
p274_354 The pain is still acute
p274_355 Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items
p274_356 It's wonderful to have won
p274_357 This might seem like an outrageous assertion
p274_358 Governments will have to respond
p274_359 We have very limited capacity
p274_360 It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped
p274_361 It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem
p274_362 We are in a global market
p274_363 The Allies intend to maintain the average
p274_364 Italy was just behind the US
p274_365 It was a unanimous decision
p274_366 Do not forget about Monaco
p274_367 He had no previous convictions
p274_368 But the Foreign Secretary can cope
p274_369 I got a yellow card
p274_370 Does it matter ?)
p274_371 How do you take them away ?)
p274_372 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?)
p274_373 After the match, do you ?)
p274_374 It had been a magical moment
p274_375 From our point of view, the player is free to leave
p274_376 Yesterday was a statement of intent
p274_377 Those people must be accountable
p274_378 Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight
p274_379 Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited
p274_380 Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat
p274_381 This hasn't happened in a vacuum
p274_382 Both of those promises have already been honoured
p274_383 It was like a weekly wage
p274_384 In addition, it was in breach of natural justice
p274_385 It will be completed within a year
p274_386 The pair are very much in love
p274_387 Everything is now in place for Manchester
p274_388 The group will also become an Internet service provider
p274_389 Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors
p274_390 Glasgow University declined to comment
p274_391 It runs until the beginning of June
p274_392 He has earned the right to their respect
p274_393 The law would appear to be on our side
p274_394 The board meetings will be held in Edinburgh
p274_396 There was a substantial explosion
p274_397 It's never great to finish second
p274_398 Finally, he paid for the movie
p274_399 The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account
p274_400 It has only been rumours
p274_401 He put some colour into Scottish history
p274_402 Clark is back on top form
p274_403 We're not taking any risks
p274_404 Neither man has been charged
p274_405 The members have voted against it
p274_406 It's too close to call
p274_407 Nobody will be forced to work
p274_408 I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson
p274_409 I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters
p274_410 I've had a wonderful career
p274_411 However, the players should have a voice in these matters
p274_412 Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents
p274_413 But the foundations have been laid
p274_414 That is the ultimate revenge
p274_415 It's just a training thing
p274_416 A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire
p274_417 They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune
p274_418 George is on a two-day visit to Scotland
p274_419 The second goal was superb
p274_420 Hopefully, the answer is in the positive
p274_421 I was pleased with my own game
p274_422 This market has been neglected by the whisky industry
p274_423 This should put downward pressure on inflation
p274_424 Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground
p274_425 The projections are very positive for South Africa
p274_426 Being captain of this club is fantastic
p274_427 Such an attack is bizarre
p274_428 It needs to be volatile
p274_429 I never had a childhood
p274_430 The need for any new UN resolutions will be put on hold
p274_431 A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed
p274_432 The trial will open today
p274_433 There is another important factor
p274_434 This is a limited market
p274_435 Its failure is no surprise
p274_436 No doubt the council would welcome the proposal
p274_437 The Festival is prepared to help
p274_438 Strangely enough I felt very sharp
p274_439 His message was very simple
p274_440 The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment
p274_441 I didn't get to keep it
p274_442 Their condition is described as satisfactory
p274_443 Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities
p274_444 They are interior designers and architects
p274_445 Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra
p274_446 It wouldn't matter if he had
p274_447 No further details of expansion plans were given
p274_448 The villagers were shot in the head at short range
p274_449 It is pretty bad news
p274_450 We just thought it would be kept under the carpet
p274_451 It could cause a little bit of disruption
p274_452 But we have built a platform for next season
p274_453 I think the goalkeeper should have gone
p274_454 We think a lot of Allan McGregor
p274_455 It was like someone had died
p274_456 They offer a kind of narrative
p274_457 We're still the only ones in the High Street
p274_458 A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing
p274_459 Now that business is banned
p274_460 Let that be their memorial
p274_461 The boys are mentally focused
p274_462 Driving has been the key
p274_463 It's because they can't understand the language
p274_464 Then came the farewell to Europe
p274_465 The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue
p274_466 Phil Mickelson did that last year
p274_467 The answer was up there on the stage
p274_468 It recommended that they reject the proposed legislation
p274_469 He will not be involved in school discipline
p274_470 You have to have a proven track record to get them
p276_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p276_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p276_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p276_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p276_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p276_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p276_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p276_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p276_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p276_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p276_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p276_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p276_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p276_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p276_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p276_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p276_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p276_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p276_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p276_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p276_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p276_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p276_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p276_025 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p276_026 How are you, sir ?
p276_027 So is that it, then ?
p276_028 Do I have a favourite ?
p276_029 What do we do ?
p276_030 They might have asked, for goodness sake
p276_031 Smoking is also very important
p276_032 We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage
p276_033 Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected
p276_034 He said police inquiries should not be conducted as political opportunism
p276_035 There was a rush of water
p276_036 A fiver and I'll tell
p276_037 We speak about the performance
p276_038 She is employed on short-term contracts
p276_039 Further management changes are planned
p276_040 I can feel the sound inside
p276_041 Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy
p276_042 He is married with three children
p276_043 I might well have done so already
p276_044 This is slightly negative for inflation
p276_045 And they had a case
p276_046 We believe a third party was involved
p276_047 Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism
p276_048 It carried a double message
p276_049 Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing
p276_050 But not a penny has been paid
p276_051 Perhaps it is eyeing a mortgage bank
p276_052 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p276_053 The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager
p276_054 Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect
p276_055 This represents a tough game for us
p276_056 They have shown a great desire and attitude
p276_057 Among them are many criminals
p276_058 And they removed a Borderer
p276_059 He is too weak to move
p276_060 Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight
p276_061 They desperately want some stability
p276_062 Everything is possible in football
p276_063 We like being the underdogs
p276_064 He looks like an Afghan
p276_065 This trend is likely to strengthen
p276_066 He will need that machine
p276_067 Then they scored two goals to win
p276_068 Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market
p276_069 Pulled a huge number of viewers
p276_070 The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government
p276_071 Let's not be too despondent
p276_072 There was no safety net
p276_073 The Government does not go far enough
p276_074 He phoned the number in the brochure
p276_075 A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said
p276_076 He confirmed that the document was valid
p276_077 The wingers must have felt the cold
p276_078 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p276_079 I have made that offer
p276_080 Why do it otherwise ?
p276_081 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p276_082 So, did she meet him ?
p276_083 So what is the campaign about ?
p276_084 The new deal will now be put to the officers
p276_085 Carlton also declined to comment last night
p276_086 But the organisers refused to worry
p276_087 Webster was brought up in Glasgow
p276_088 Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions
p276_089 Autumn is the time of fulfilment
p276_090 The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee
p276_091 He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it
p276_092 Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles
p276_093 Funding needs to be long term
p276_094 We should all be grateful
p276_095 He's not getting into any games
p276_096 The coach is a man who is very ambitious
p276_097 We are talking about the outskirts of London
p276_098 It was exactly four months away
p276_099 This is equally relevant to the landowner
p276_100 THE Farmer wants a new campaign
p276_101 We are satisfied with this outcome
p276_102 Robin Williams is very subdued
p276_103 It wasn't possible to relax
p276_104 Context is also very important
p276_105 There could be a way back
p276_106 They do not work for Glasgow City Council
p276_107 Both sides have been hit by injury
p276_108 People had been talking about a fourth quarter rally
p276_109 Even the one she loved
p276_110 Talk of a crisis is absurd
p276_111 He's been active in Arabia
p276_112 England were ahead until two minutes into injury time
p276_113 Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat
p276_114 It is sometimes like that
p276_115 He was unprepared for this fight
p276_116 I've had it for the exams
p276_117 Those people must be accountable
p276_118 If they liked it then I'll be happy
p276_119 It's very bad timing, but it's happened
p276_120 Choice is a good thing
p276_121 I am not very pleased
p276_122 New Zealand rugby is totally different
p276_123 Petrol prices were widely blamed
p276_124 Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat
p276_125 Accordingly, financial restructuring is required
p276_126 Many others are subjected to violence by men
p276_127 Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed
p276_128 Florida is the pivotal state in the nation
p276_129 They lived for their children
p276_130 Potions said he would drive
p276_131 Diversions were put in place
p276_132 The Queen Mother is dead
p276_133 No one person or small group could be singled out
p276_134 The excitement could hardly be contained
p276_135 Margins are also in retreat
p276_136 Dancing will help his ankles and his feet
p276_137 He had missed a penalty against the English
p276_138 The outsourcing deal will take effect in September
p276_139 I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar
p276_140 It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed
p276_141 Cutting ticket prices would certainly help
p276_142 We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football
p276_143 Absences should be carefully monitored
p276_144 Four meetings have previously been arranged
p276_145 The rise in retail sales was the first since August
p276_146 Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future
p276_147 We just have to adapt
p276_148 Are you from the rugby ?
p276_149 What happened in that game ?
p276_150 Are you going to win ?
p276_151 Was it the wife ?
p276_152 Why change it ?
p276_153 And they all have a vote
p276_154 But they must believe in themselves
p276_155 Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us
p276_156 Token gestures of tiny tax cuts will not do
p276_157 We made a world record together
p276_158 This is the logic of punishment assaults
p276_159 But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant
p276_160 That was the first time I worked with Richard
p276_161 They said so that I would look good in uniform
p276_162 A good actor doesn't think
p276_163 That's what happened against Ayr
p276_164 Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly
p276_165 He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by
p276_166 It is a good lifestyle
p276_167 Before the game we went for a pint
p276_168 City sentiment is in his favour
p276_169 His job was not advertised
p276_170 Nato has left them with no other option
p276_171 Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive
p276_172 He was just like a godfather to it
p276_173 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p276_174 Yet the survey has been cautious
p276_175 These people are now following their own Unison agenda
p276_176 It took five months to repair the damage
p276_177 They exist in name alone
p276_178 Advice and counselling will be offered
p276_179 You had better believe it
p276_180 It was a sobering experience
p276_181 I can see it now
p276_182 There's still plenty time left
p276_183 Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee
p276_184 I've no idea how it works
p276_185 The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost
p276_186 The festivals will be about having fun
p276_187 This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service
p276_188 She is in good spirits
p276_189 The changes took effect from June
p276_190 As if that is an achievement
p276_191 That will be the sweetness
p276_192 Sacking John Redwood is a disaster
p276_193 Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month
p276_194 There was a fossil on screen
p276_195 The protest will go ahead as planned
p276_196 I did not concentrate on my performance
p276_197 The feedback from them has been fantastic
p276_198 That admission is not surprising
p276_199 But he rejected calls for a public register of paedophiles
p276_200 However, the problem is the timing
p276_201 Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax
p276_202 That was just one night
p276_203 This is a frightening development
p276_204 They keep the atmosphere in mind
p276_205 Millions of British jobs depend on Europe
p276_206 Sloppy answers are to be avoided
p276_207 That is an entirely unacceptable position
p276_208 My father died in childbirth
p276_209 It is quite a thing to watch
p276_210 This should begin in October
p276_211 Twaddle is a case in point
p276_212 The Yugoslav army will still be there
p276_213 Some promoters made insulting offers
p276_214 We did what we had to do
p276_215 The squad is too small
p276_216 What do we want to do that for ?
p276_217 Does the name matter ?
p276_218 how do you get it back ?
p276_219 What are you not good at ?
p276_220 I think, therefore I am ?
p276_221 You've got to be vigilant
p276_222 I learned that only yesterday
p276_223 It's been a humbling year
p276_224 Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands
p276_225 You are a gambling man
p276_226 Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces
p276_227 My daughter is an adult
p276_228 I would not say that
p276_229 There was a fine line to tread
p276_230 The refund is fully justified
p276_231 I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio
p276_232 I never wanted a legal battle
p276_233 It would make a lot of sense
p276_234 It was started almost by accident
p276_235 The partnership was set up during the summer
p276_236 Bottling is now the core business
p276_237 She died at her home
p276_238 Had this been common practice ?
p276_239 What do they want us to do ?
p276_240 Is it worth it ?
p276_241 Does it matter ?
p276_242 How do you take them away ?
p276_243 Frankly, it was worth the booking
p276_244 People have been wonderful beyond belief
p276_245 We were right to be afraid
p276_247 That group reported just before Christmas
p276_248 Five minutes later, the home team were back in front
p276_249 Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes
p276_250 I COULD tell that Alastair Wilkie was energised
p276_251 That view has not altered
p276_252 No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday
p276_253 For business, the benefits will be enormous
p276_254 The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups
p276_255 Five years later, the deception continued
p276_256 Finding suitable replacements would not be easy
p276_257 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p276_258 I felt we deserved the three points
p276_259 Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow
p276_260 They've got some extremely good players
p276_261 Mr Blair had done well
p276_262 She had gone to the Catholic school
p276_263 Then we will face the Danish champions
p276_264 The family kept away from me
p276_265 I would have been shot dead in bed
p276_266 One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas
p276_267 The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible
p276_268 We will turn the corner
p276_269 Of course, it is a tough assignment
p276_270 My Dad is a hero
p276_271 And they were being paid ?
p276_272 was everything done to save people ?
p276_273 What was the matter for concern ?
p276_274 Do I think about them often ?
p276_275 Is it in the right place ?
p276_276 Did he trip ?
p276_277 This wasn't just a big crowd
p276_278 It was a terrible combination of factors
p276_279 This is absolutely not true
p276_280 This might seem like an outrageous assertion
p276_281 They should stop the bombing
p276_282 Sunday's game against Celtic is huge
p276_283 I've come here for the jersey
p276_284 The question is whether private investors should follow their example
p276_285 The strong performance is expected to continue
p276_286 Their extinction is not inevitable
p276_287 It's never great to finish second
p276_288 And, finally, I have good news for the songbirds of Glasgow
p276_289 It's as eventful as it is momentous
p276_290 We have a budget in March
p276_291 Initial market reaction was close to euphoric
p276_292 However, he urged the trade to keep the faith
p276_293 That would open the gates of hell
p276_294 Bobby Williamson has been brilliant
p276_295 We've made a couple of albums
p276_296 A more exhaustive analysis is in progress
p276_297 We have to keep our clients
p276_298 Manchester United can win the European Cup this season
p276_299 First, the programme was unbalanced
p276_300 Everything else is a bonus
p276_301 This championship is different from the other majors
p276_302 At the top level, the salaries are far too high
p276_303 Harrowing is easy, after all
p276_304 Each case is treated on merit
p276_305 A winter of discontent awaits
p276_306 They are determined to make a meaningful contribution
p276_307 I am astonished at attack
p276_308 Says the Duke of York
p276_309 Our destiny is in our own hands
p276_310 Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager
p276_311 Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute
p276_312 She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport
p276_313 We've had great things in the past
p276_314 It could be done by experts and lawyers
p276_315 It was horrible, that musical apartheid
p276_316 It has been recorded twice
p276_317 Aberdeen had little to offer
p276_318 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p276_319 I'm interested in interesting work
p276_320 We represent a wide range of society
p276_321 It caused a lot of upset
p276_322 I saw them last week
p276_323 Does that put pressure on us ?
p276_324 Did it work ?
p276_325 Do you think we are a top nation ?
p276_326 Is our children learning ?
p276_327 How independent is that ?
p276_328 What form did that take ?
p276_329 Are they free ?
p276_330 Friday night was a pretty good night
p276_331 This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds
p276_332 You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice
p276_333 We are trying to clarify the issues
p276_334 I was inspired by two things
p276_335 The Government has completely lost control of GM crops
p276_336 MOVIE stars are public property
p276_337 It comes from reflection or thinking
p276_338 That moment when the monster is being brought to life
p276_339 Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer
p276_340 Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow
p276_341 Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon
p276_342 The company hopes to repeat the process in France
p276_343 And we have the experience
p276_344 The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions
p276_345 This included a downward revision in the expected level of dividend
p276_346 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p276_347 You just have to give yourself a chance
p276_348 They would be supported by visiting specialists
p276_349 You have caught a serial killer
p276_350 I won't make an official complaint
p276_351 It was worth a photograph
p276_352 I grew up with that in the amateur game
p276_353 The move follows a review of the Singapore
p276_354 They make a selective perception process
p276_355 Employees may be taken on at Livingston
p276_356 There is no quick fix
p276_357 What are they for ?
p276_358 Is there a waiting list ?
p276_359 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p276_360 So what happens next ?
p276_361 Thereafter they were allowed to proceed
p276_362 Walker plans to return indoors
p276_363 It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years
p276_364 He worked there for six months
p276_365 HARRY Potter has lost his magic
p276_366 The business has expanded rapidly, however
p276_367 From there, they can go anywhere
p276_368 I had relied on him
p276_369 Truth is the child of time
p276_370 The Reporter appears to have undue influence on the panel
p276_372 Anyway, the job will be part-time
p276_373 Brown has always protested his innocence
p276_374 And the World Cup has not even begun
p276_375 He remains a main board director of Royal
p276_376 This is the version which appeared in our paper
p276_377 Instead, he missed the lot
p276_378 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p276_379 Laura is an investment banker
p276_380 Market research indicates that this is not feasible
p276_381 Women were mostly notable by their absence
p276_382 His background is firmly in venture capital
p276_383 We played them off the pitch
p276_384 But the rally was short-lived
p276_385 McCall is unlikely to change a winning team
p276_386 It must be tough to live with
p276_387 The statement contained no surprises
p276_388 Six other people were injured
p276_389 He said the winner had been chosen by consensus
p276_390 We can't give any figures for Edinburgh
p276_391 Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh
p276_392 They would have to go to the Royal
p276_393 It didn't matter who was in their way
p276_394 He ended up a headmaster
p276_395 North African countries are also seen as potential customers
p276_396 He is obviously very dangerous
p276_397 The most important thing in theatre is to listen
p276_398 That remains the unanswered question
p276_399 You should always be able to get out in some direction
p276_400 It depends on Labour, not on us
p276_401 It had so much to do with output
p276_402 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p276_403 After the match, do you ?
p276_404 Has the conflict started ?
p276_405 Have I really come to this ?
p276_406 David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme
p276_407 Its failure is no surprise
p276_408 It has to be enforced
p276_409 Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families
p276_410 Those overseas offices were great
p276_411 You will have seen the adverts
p276_412 Recent reports suggested it might be sold off
p276_413 Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie
p276_414 No plans for projects are yet in place
p276_415 Three weeks later, he resigned
p276_416 A succession of managers in the opera company resigned
p276_417 Venus rejects the very suggestion
p276_418 A, The media has been great
p276_419 Everything has its place and purpose
p276_420 I have received no explanation
p276_421 Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country
p276_422 He also launched a new strategy for the agency
p276_423 You didn't need to pay
p276_424 The might be rolled out
p276_425 But nothing could be done
p276_426 They made such decisions in London
p276_427 Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential
p276_428 It seems a waste of talents
p276_429 Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service
p276_430 This would discourage investment and job creation
p276_431 We have no information on Iraq
p276_432 If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help
p276_433 George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision
p276_434 The company declined to comment
p276_435 It makes no difference to their friendship
p276_436 They make the right decisions
p276_437 I always savour the company of The Voice
p276_438 It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused
p276_439 Today has been a good day for Northern Ireland
p276_440 I got a yellow card
p276_441 It's an option, but I can't really comment
p276_442 Not many people like to do that
p276_443 He now lives in Fenwick in Ayrshire
p276_444 I might also completely change the routine
p276_445 We accept the new rules
p276_446 He was due to retire in December
p276_447 We go there with confidence
p276_448 They are interior designers and architects
p276_449 He was released after treatment
p276_450 I rejected the idea of a separate residence
p276_451 When I was four years old I used to do like this
p276_452 They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game
p276_453 I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me
p276_454 They must play for each other
p276_455 We are aiming for early March
p276_456 Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia
p276_457 The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high
p276_458 It will take place in July
p276_459 There's not much money in cycling
p276_460 We will pay their bills
p276_461 This court has made an order which has not been observed
p276_462 It was very positive and very helpful
p276_463 Now we see no mention of rising rates
p276_464 Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday
p276_465 We are having a look
p277_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p277_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p277_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p277_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p277_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p277_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p277_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p277_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p277_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p277_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p277_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p277_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p277_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p277_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p277_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p277_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p277_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p277_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p277_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p277_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p277_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p277_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p277_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p277_025 People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background
p277_026 Is this accurate?
p277_027 They have no history
p277_028 Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected
p277_029 The abuse of elderly people was appalling
p277_030 There's a story, too
p277_031 This is the window
p277_032 He was jailed for five years
p277_033 Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist
p277_034 We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude
p277_035 Then, suddenly, they weren't
p277_036 Was it worth it?
p277_037 Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night
p277_038 However, they continued in their pursuit of victory
p277_039 We have to pull together, or we will hang apart
p277_040 They're just different
p277_041 Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack
p277_042 A quality audit officer has also been appointed
p277_043 Indeed, he does
p277_044 I did not see any reason to change the captain
p277_045 He's just in it for himself
p277_046 However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials
p277_047 It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside
p277_048 We will push
p277_049 Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion
p277_050 This represents a tough game for us
p277_051 It is bizarre
p277_052 They said she was stable
p277_053 Is a drug dealer?
p277_054 The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids
p277_055 He is too weak to move
p277_056 They were on holiday in Egypt
p277_057 He looks like an Afghan
p277_058 No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death
p277_059 Here's a clue
p277_060 It had been in place since last July
p277_061 Next league matches Celtic
p277_062 There was no safety net
p277_063 It is unique
p277_064 That's the truth
p277_065 They are ready
p277_066 We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter
p277_067 I feel I did not have enough time
p277_068 The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow
p277_069 George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision
p277_070 They are real
p277_071 Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued
p277_072 That was a gold medal for certain
p277_073 He was popular
p277_074 But I've won both ways
p277_075 There was an e-mail
p277_076 Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p277_077 Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses
p277_078 Painful, but only because it's true
p277_079 I had my suspicions
p277_080 He was at home with his pals
p277_081 It was magic
p277_082 The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow
p277_083 It is a job creation scheme
p277_084 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p277_085 Even the one she loved
p277_086 Today she has been released
p277_087 He is in the queue
p277_088 He liked to give the impression of being a hard man
p277_089 What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p277_090 Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money
p277_091 Someone who cares
p277_092 By then, he was walking on water
p277_093 It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats
p277_094 It is a blow
p277_095 Florida is the pivotal state in the nation
p277_096 They lived for their children
p277_097 Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today
p277_098 Today I couldn't run on it
p277_099 This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit
p277_100 I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes
p277_101 It was clear
p277_102 It is annoying
p277_103 But I was wrong
p277_104 I love the Dome
p277_105 We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football
p277_106 Our position remains unchanged
p277_107 I wish I had put on a brighter tie
p277_108 Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights
p277_109 Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults
p277_110 You should be
p277_111 After that time, the market itself will set the prices
p277_112 Two of the team became ill
p277_113 He takes the job
p277_114 She reflects a bit
p277_115 I am just trying to do my job
p277_116 Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday
p277_117 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p277_118 I was fighting for my life, I thought
p277_119 Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals
p277_120 It is so sad
p277_121 The mood is upbeat
p277_122 It is rubbish
p277_123 That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships
p277_124 There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end
p277_125 Who would have?
p277_126 There were no grounds for his action
p277_127 I can't even get into the A team
p277_128 I'm so angry
p277_129 She really suffered for her art
p277_130 It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation
p277_131 The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies
p277_132 No production was achieved
p277_133 The BBC was a disgrace
p277_134 This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby
p277_135 It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work
p277_136 The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday
p277_137 Police could not say if the two incidents were connected
p277_138 Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October
p277_139 On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door
p277_140 It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions
p277_141 I had decided to quit the show
p277_142 We want to keep the pound
p277_143 Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray
p277_144 And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life
p277_145 Who would be right?
p277_146 She died at her home
p277_147 He realises his mistake
p277_148 The role of the law lords would be retained
p277_149 It is not just about pay
p277_150 Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday
p277_151 So I got a blood test
p277_152 It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment
p277_153 But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company
p277_154 I was so nervous
p277_155 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p277_156 The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday
p277_157 We also enjoyed a lot of support
p277_158 We are on a four-year mission
p277_159 They should come clean
p277_160 My Dad is a hero
p277_161 He can do no wrong
p277_162 Well, he should know
p277_163 It is so unfair
p277_164 I will tell you
p277_165 I've put my own money into this project
p277_166 Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks
p277_167 It is not like us
p277_168 We've all had the shots
p277_169 It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful
p277_170 Again, we were lucky
p277_171 Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final
p277_172 Does that put pressure on us?
p277_173 It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate
p277_174 They might be broken, but they are not defeated
p277_175 As we worked
p277_176 Tony had arrived
p277_177 And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience
p277_178 Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted
p277_179 It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area
p277_180 They need to look after themselves
p277_181 I saw military vehicles in the distance
p277_182 What has caused the demise of singing?
p277_183 Our team is just so young
p277_184 Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval
p277_185 Suddenly, the rugby world had changed
p277_186 Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender
p277_187 But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections
p277_188 Peace was won
p277_189 It's a fact
p277_190 The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address
p277_191 We believe a third party was involved
p277_192 On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult
p277_193 Tommy is not a problem
p277_194 I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February
p277_195 But she might be
p277_196 I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling
p277_197 It was worth a photograph
p277_198 They make a selective perception process
p277_199 We have an election in eight days
p277_200 Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement
p277_201 This gives a financial incentive to switch
p277_202 The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors
p277_203 Twaddle is a case in point
p277_204 A Grampian Police spokesman said
p277_205 He sees a difference in the style of the two teams
p277_206 In each case they were a goal down
p277_207 I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery
p277_208 However, Dundee deserved to win this game
p277_209 The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers
p277_210 The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo
p277_211 Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E
p277_212 I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision
p277_213 At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher
p277_214 You should always be able to get out in some direction
p277_215 It's not before time
p277_216 The report is due out next month
p277_217 But she was
p277_218 Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern
p277_219 At the time, he was a living legend
p277_220 They must do it
p277_221 Dewar was certainly under attack from within his own party
p277_222 However, no further action was taken by police
p277_223 Until they came to do it
p277_224 Half of young people had had contact with the police
p277_225 Well, they were the unlucky ones
p277_226 There is no excuse
p277_228 On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence
p277_229 But it's a subtle process
p277_230 He also launched a new strategy for the agency
p277_231 Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order
p277_232 In fact, it is deeply unpleasant
p277_233 A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe
p277_234 It is hard won
p277_235 Our policy is clear
p277_236 The scene is about this?
p277_237 The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery
p277_238 There wasn't a goal
p277_239 I should think so, too
p277_240 There's the mix
p277_241 The concerns are the same
p277_242 I can't get a job
p277_243 For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique
p277_244 It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit
p277_245 However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely
p277_246 One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning
p277_248 Is that a serious question?
p277_249 This is the first step
p277_250 They must play for each other
p277_251 Souter will be back
p277_252 George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks
p277_253 Blood samples were taken
p277_254 They want to shut the Scottish Office
p277_255 We shall rely on human beings
p277_256 This is a question of Islam
p277_257 He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant
p277_258 Immediate action must be taken
p277_259 It's very nice
p277_260 He was also married with two children
p277_261 The system can work
p277_262 It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence
p277_263 We're in shock
p277_264 Our objective is to tackle poverty
p277_265 It's a way of life
p277_266 The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline
p277_267 It was very fast
p277_268 The record companies have gone through the floor
p277_269 He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention
p277_270 In fact, he was talking about the survival business
p277_271 If not, he should go home
p277_272 It is not a process which can be completed overnight
p277_273 He looked very sharp
p277_274 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p277_275 All options are open
p277_276 Dialogue is the key
p277_277 They have shown a great desire and attitude
p277_278 It was a virus
p277_279 Maloney is an engaging talent
p277_280 The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together
p277_281 This is a national crisis
p277_282 It was good
p277_283 Who did the recruiting?
p277_284 Bombing slaughter rejected
p277_285 The songs are just so good
p277_286 The goals will come
p277_287 There's a pause
p277_288 That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients
p277_289 I was the sheep
p277_290 What has altered?
p277_291 I was brought up in a mining background
p277_292 Nothing is safe
p277_293 It would still have been a good film, but very different
p277_294 One was a lawyer
p277_295 The most important thing is to get a programme for government
p277_296 They are wrong
p277_297 Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school
p277_298 The plot is minimal
p277_299 You are the glory
p277_300 However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart
p277_301 The letters are going out today
p277_302 We want to play at the worlds
p277_303 He is also keen to win the European order of merit
p277_304 My whole life has changed
p277_305 We are a peaceful people
p277_306 You may have a short memory
p277_307 It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register
p277_308 My body is clearly capable
p277_309 Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed
p277_310 It is a private matter between the firm and our staff
p277_311 A review is under way
p277_312 It will work
p277_313 I came into this world with nothing
p277_314 It's too horrible to think
p277_315 We think all other measures are not exhausted
p277_316 Off with their heads
p277_317 Is there a new way forward?
p277_318 I was invited to work in Germany
p277_319 Is that an issue?
p277_320 Later in the day he was forced to explain his position
p277_321 You have to be able to deal with all age groups
p277_322 The same things will happen with GM foods
p277_323 I would be quite happy for the money to be given back
p277_324 It sounded as if it might well be tragic
p277_325 Well, it won't
p277_326 These days are long gone
p277_327 Two people were interviewed
p277_328 I've got no secret
p277_329 The package was expected to be launched within the next three months
p277_330 We lost our composure towards the interval, he said
p277_331 In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre
p277_332 Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match
p277_333 A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference
p277_334 This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required
p277_335 He loves the big occasions
p277_336 The performance was excellent
p277_337 That has been lost
p277_338 Tell us about it
p277_339 He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal
p277_340 She said they would appeal
p277_341 A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company
p277_342 Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday
p277_343 Both of those promises have already been honoured
p277_344 In addition, it was in breach of natural justice
p277_346 As, indeed, they would be
p277_347 It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage
p277_348 To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential
p277_349 We will be homeless
p277_350 Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported
p277_351 Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment
p277_352 Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games
p277_353 There was a substantial explosion
p277_354 Not so, it seems
p277_355 He could make it
p277_356 Four policemen were wounded
p277_357 We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy
p277_358 It's now down in black and white
p277_359 Now, though, he has an incentive
p277_360 Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again
p277_361 They have not done so this season so far
p277_362 This big issue is whether it can be enforced
p277_363 It took about an hour for the gas to clear
p277_364 So there, we won
p277_365 By that time, however, it was already too late
p277_366 There is no signature
p277_367 It was a funny game
p277_368 He was the architect
p277_369 I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters
p277_370 I've never seen a game like it
p277_371 I am a wealthy person
p277_372 Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter
p277_373 He's delighted, too, with the new premises
p277_374 The Cabinet is split over the issue
p277_375 Something is wrong
p277_376 You can cope with it
p277_377 I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday
p277_378 That's the name of the game, though
p277_379 Since then, he has played no active part in the company
p277_380 Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director
p277_381 Family liaison officers are now working to support the family
p277_382 At the last I found a bunker
p277_383 Yet the data is compelling
p277_384 One day, he threw the baby against a wall
p277_385 It's a real problem
p277_386 On the contrary, it was actually very funny
p277_387 I was in the train station overnight
p277_388 It is unusual
p277_389 The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia
p277_390 It's like a basketball
p277_391 Well, it did last time, he was reminded
p277_392 I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title
p277_393 The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position
p277_394 It was a kind of contempt
p277_395 It was a breathtaking moment
p277_396 The car was just there
p277_397 It will take place in July
p277_398 The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today
p277_399 Is that possible?
p277_400 But, in fact, the reverse is true
p277_401 What was the difference between them?
p277_402 Emotions were complex
p277_403 Then , he laughs
p277_404 Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter
p277_405 It is an absolute nonsense
p277_406 They recorded their debut album in New York
p277_407 However, the players should have a voice in these matters
p277_408 He has written to the minister after meetings on the island
p277_409 But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition
p277_410 Feel the air, the space
p277_411 He got his degree
p277_412 I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death
p277_413 went on sale
p277_414 But we finished the show
p277_415 Mentally, you have to be tough
p277_416 The people around me were fantastic
p277_417 I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh
p277_418 It is legally binding
p277_419 Is there any prospect of this happening?
p277_420 There's been a mistake
p277_421 We just got a phone call on Saturday night
p277_422 Eriksson would have approved
p277_423 I am extremely cautious
p277_424 It was little else
p277_425 It all began as an accident
p277_426 The MoD has denied any cover-up
p277_427 I know the worry over Iraq
p277_428 It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult
p277_429 Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline
p277_430 The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society
p277_431 We are all equal
p277_432 It's been a long, long journey
p277_433 We were used
p277_434 Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister
p277_435 However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action
p277_436 They were not even allowed to see them
p277_437 That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano
p277_438 Horses are drawn by ballot
p277_439 It won the match
p277_440 And it showed
p277_441 The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing
p277_442 I hate the word
p277_443 Who would be in that desert?
p277_444 I was lost
p277_445 The children are fine
p277_446 They have to come up with a solution
p277_447 That was the first time I worked with Richard
p277_448 The whole region is in shock
p277_449 When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson
p277_450 It was a total disaster
p277_451 There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee
p277_452 I got a yellow card
p277_453 Stewart was the life and soul of the party
p277_454 Scotland has a dismal record of teenage pregnancy rates
p277_455 We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that
p277_456 If they don't, they should say so
p277_457 It is a vicious circle
p277_458 Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced
p277_459 She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers
p277_460 I'd love to be like Peter
p277_461 I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target
p277_462 From our point of view, the player is free to leave
p277_463 The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published
p278_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p278_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p278_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p278_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p278_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p278_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p278_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p278_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p278_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p278_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p278_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p278_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p278_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p278_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p278_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p278_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p278_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p278_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p278_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p278_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p278_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p278_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p278_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p278_025 A shortlist is to be drawn up next month
p278_026 These decisions are not simple
p278_027 Life was like a timetable
p278_028 She is employed on short-term contracts
p278_029 They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life
p278_030 The director will be present
p278_031 Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons
p278_032 If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it
p278_033 It carried a double message
p278_034 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p278_035 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p278_036 Several investments have already been made
p278_037 It was a hell of a way to lose
p278_038 Among them are many criminals
p278_039 The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood
p278_040 This will get their attention
p278_041 Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight
p278_042 Well, the climate has changed
p278_043 Must be prepared to use it
p278_044 He looks like an Afghan
p278_045 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p278_046 How are you, sir ?
p278_047 So is that it, then ?
p278_048 Do I have a favourite ?
p278_049 He will need that machine
p278_050 I have learned from him
p278_051 I had trouble with the producers
p278_052 He also presented You Bet!
p278_053 People come to see the Highlands
p278_054 They are to ensure information reaches as many members as possible
p278_055 We have not given up hope
p278_056 She said she was really sorry
p278_057 None has ever been found
p278_058 Let's hope that it does
p278_059 The baby was later transferred to a hospital in Glasgow
p278_060 It was exactly four months away
p278_061 Charles Kennedy had an effective outing
p278_062 Only water is currently allowed
p278_063 I'm looking to the future
p278_064 But it has been an amazing experience
p278_065 The judge was really nice
p278_066 The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister
p278_067 The fans would love it
p278_068 Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator
p278_069 The party is up for it
p278_070 Even the one she loved
p278_071 It was a unanimous decision
p278_072 It's all going to clear the debt
p278_073 This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst
p278_074 Last week, he was taken into hospital
p278_075 Petrol prices were widely blamed
p278_076 By then, he was walking on water
p278_077 We have to offer value for money
p278_078 It's so hard to shift
p278_079 Mr Smith declined to comment
p278_080 Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll
p278_081 That was a great performance by the team
p278_082 He said a change in legislation was long overdue
p278_083 The allegations were still under investigation, he added
p278_084 Everyone had to play the game
p278_085 It was worth a photograph
p278_086 It was clear on Thursday
p278_087 It's not a holiday time for football players
p278_088 But they must believe in themselves
p278_089 We haven't finished the complaints procedure
p278_090 However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full
p278_091 Thomson is expected to manage the business
p278_092 The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened
p278_093 It was some time before she found out he was safe
p278_094 In the end we made too many errors
p278_095 That time is not now, however
p278_096 We created so many chances
p278_097 Our house was very small
p278_098 Why do it otherwise ?
p278_099 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p278_100 So, did she meet him ?
p278_101 So what is the campaign about ?
p278_102 And does it ?
p278_103 Are you from the rugby ?
p278_104 Had I heard ?
p278_105 Athletics is on a roll in the country
p278_106 We needed financial backing to get it off the ground
p278_107 I was just appalled at the way they behaved
p278_108 We have got a race
p278_109 The music industry hasn't changed at all
p278_110 Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National
p278_111 He was jailed for a year
p278_112 They almost achieved a draw
p278_113 Football is a passion for many
p278_114 I didn't think so either
p278_115 It was located on the remote control
p278_116 Maybe this battle has been
p278_117 That might help a bit
p278_118 This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service
p278_119 Ferguson will be a millionaire
p278_120 You can spend money on housing
p278_121 The hearing was due to continue today
p278_122 There will be no shortage of quality applicants
p278_123 However, the problem is the timing
p278_124 This is a frightening development
p278_125 Which can happen any time
p278_126 It was not a finale he would want to remember
p278_127 We had another last Tuesday
p278_128 I didn't feel under any pressure
p278_129 This should begin in October
p278_130 That first victory made a huge difference to my career
p278_131 The abuse of elderly people was appalling
p278_132 Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland
p278_133 That would open the gates of hell
p278_134 You've got to be vigilant
p278_135 But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner
p278_136 The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office
p278_137 Before it was an ordeal
p278_138 It will affect their work
p278_139 I love the spectacle of cinema
p278_140 They could use a boost
p278_141 Frankly, it was worth the booking
p278_142 Anyone can do the sums
p278_143 Others are not so sure
p278_144 I have always loved the countryside
p278_145 It was his job to check
p278_146 I haven't made any definite decisions
p278_147 There's always the next century
p278_148 There's only one team in Ayrshire
p278_149 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p278_150 I prefer the clarity of the existing system
p278_151 Nothing was meant by it
p278_152 The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms
p278_153 Its loss was an economic catastrophe for the whole of Moray
p278_154 It was by the numbers
p278_155 I knew he was good
p278_156 We will turn the corner
p278_157 Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics
p278_158 These days are long gone
p278_159 Worry can have that effect on some citizens
p278_160 The strong performance is expected to continue
p278_161 The Internet is no substitute for customer service
p278_162 So was the first half
p278_163 It's never great to finish second
p278_164 You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues
p278_165 We have a budget in March
p278_166 He is keen to stay in public service
p278_167 As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead
p278_168 US is the only country to vote against resolution
p278_169 Further growth will be funded from cash flow
p278_170 On my day I can beat anyone
p278_171 We've made a couple of albums
p278_172 My life has been destroyed
p278_173 What happened in that game ?
p278_174 Are you going to win ?
p278_175 Was it the wife ?
p278_176 Why change it ?
p278_177 What do we want to do that for ?
p278_178 I always felt they played for me
p278_179 His team management was protective
p278_180 You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions
p278_181 First and foremost, the game is entirely different
p278_182 The outcome is now in our own hands
p278_183 I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal
p278_184 It is vital to clarify their role
p278_185 It appears that it was just a genuine mistake
p278_186 They are determined to make a meaningful contribution
p278_187 Says the Duke of York
p278_188 That's not fair to the supporters
p278_189 They need to look after themselves
p278_190 I've always been like that
p278_191 It could be done by experts and lawyers
p278_192 They were seriously after him
p278_193 But there's an upturn in the sector
p278_194 It shows the strength of the roots
p278_195 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p278_196 It caused a lot of upset
p278_197 However, this idea is never developed
p278_198 I had come back from London
p278_199 Last night was a key episode
p278_200 They are still very quiet
p278_201 I wanted to put myself on the line
p278_202 I came home by ambulance
p278_203 We've had an enjoyable adventure
p278_204 It comes from reflection or thinking
p278_205 Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon
p278_206 We could soon be in that same position!
p278_207 It was a horrible thing to happen
p278_208 The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday
p278_209 I am very realistic about these things
p278_210 I won't make an official complaint
p278_211 He is a good signing for Rangers
p278_212 Bombing is the easy option
p278_213 It seemed a moving and fitting tribute
p278_214 The move follows a review of the Singapore
p278_215 They make a selective perception process
p278_216 Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match
p278_217 This gives a financial incentive to switch
p278_218 They have known the hard times
p278_219 It was important to win the singles
p278_220 The only problem was the greens
p278_221 January is a bad time of year
p278_222 His injury was completely random
p278_223 Today we must not repeat that mistake
p278_224 Twaddle is a case in point
p278_225 I'm just a regular person
p278_226 My daughter is an adult
p278_227 Does the name matter ?
p278_228 how do you get it back ?
p278_229 What are you not good at ?
p278_230 I think, therefore I am ?
p278_231 Who was she ?
p278_232 It was finally agreed on Saturday
p278_233 IT S all change at Kilmarnock
p278_234 Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement
p278_235 The City welcomed the brighter outlook
p278_236 Women were mostly notable by their absence
p278_237 The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions
p278_238 I have spoken to the skipper
p278_239 So far, the problems have occurred in the US
p278_240 The statement contained no surprises
p278_241 A small number of new jobs will also be created
p278_242 This would include the GM food industry
p278_243 My wife and family are the support system
p278_244 They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house
p278_245 He does not much like the Liberal Democrats
p278_246 I need a publishing deal!
p278_247 It had so much to do with output
p278_248 A fatal accident inquiry will be held into the death
p278_249 The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high
p278_250 That will be a decision for BBC Scotland
p278_251 There were no reports of casualties
p278_252 After his birthday, Scott was very upset
p278_253 It might be sad, but it's a fact
p278_254 He also launched a new strategy for the agency
p278_255 They made such decisions in London
p278_256 It seems a waste of talents
p278_257 I was just getting over the time difference
p278_258 Defensive stocks attracted some interest
p278_259 You can feel at home in China
p278_260 We have no information on Iraq
p278_261 Persuaded to change his mind
p278_262 Paterson can afford to be generous
p278_263 Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed
p278_264 I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance
p278_265 No production contract is yet in sight
p278_266 Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland
p278_267 Messages have to be reinforced
p278_268 It is not enough to be first division champions
p278_269 We accept the new rules
p278_270 And they were being paid ?
p278_271 was everything done to save people ?
p278_272 What was the matter for concern ?
p278_273 Do I think about them often ?
p278_274 Is it in the right place ?
p278_275 Blair is very positive at European Councils
p278_276 They are interior designers and architects
p278_277 He was released after treatment
p278_278 I rejected the idea of a separate residence
p278_279 I'd never run for them
p278_280 It does not work that way in Scottish football
p278_281 Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes
p278_282 These figures are truly terrible
p278_283 The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair
p278_284 The stage was set for a showdown
p278_285 This could put pressure on UK inflation
p278_286 I'd like to report a murder
p278_287 They want to shut the Scottish Office
p278_288 It all started with a visiting rugby club
p278_289 Those overseas offices were great
p278_290 I understand the security issue
p278_291 Truth is the child of time
p278_292 It has become a way of life
p278_293 Similar measures are expected in England and Wales
p278_294 Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years
p278_295 It was never a free kick
p278_296 They failed to reach agreement yesterday
p278_297 This is a great opportunity for us
p278_298 Scottish rugby has given me everything
p278_299 You have to expect this type of thing
p278_300 However, he will have his work cut out defending his title
p278_301 So the Government will be damaged
p278_302 It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday
p278_303 Gerhard Schroeder was the victor
p278_304 John was there already in spirit
p278_305 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p278_306 I intended to look for another club on loan
p278_307 We feel very comfortable in this international environment
p278_308 He will address the nation this evening
p278_309 They have shown a great desire and attitude
p278_310 I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh
p278_311 Maloney is an engaging talent
p278_312 It's not covered by the insurance
p278_313 Mr Campbell received a phone call
p278_314 I will never change our policy on paying appearance money
p278_315 You have to see it like this
p278_316 You have asked for action
p278_317 Holland won by five wickets
p278_318 Clydesdale Bank declined to comment
p278_319 The answer was in space
p278_320 It's unlikely to be renewed
p278_321 I first met him last summer
p278_322 The songs are just so good
p278_323 The casting is as perfect
p278_324 Saturday's match was fairly straightforward
p278_325 Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear
p278_326 McNaughton was not so sure
p278_327 The dealer is on notice
p278_328 We believe the world has too many refugees already
p278_329 She had gone to the Catholic school
p278_330 The party lasted all night
p278_331 The whole matter is somewhat in the air
p278_332 Much the same thing happens in a young company
p278_333 They come to enjoy themselves
p278_334 That meant the search was unlawful
p278_335 And he goes with it
p278_336 That reflected a tumble in banking shares across the board
p278_337 We are on a four-year mission
p278_338 The letters are going out today
p278_339 We want to play at the worlds
p278_340 Do you think we are a top nation ?
p278_341 How independent is that ?
p278_342 What form did that take ?
p278_343 What are they for ?
p278_344 Is there a waiting list ?
p278_345 The advisers had some discussions, but no conclusion was reached
p278_346 The Premier League has been a huge success
p278_347 And he is immensely loyal
p278_348 It looks as though the issue, with The Scotsman is too sensitive
p278_349 Other musicians were found in retirement
p278_350 That is a trend which will be encouraged
p278_351 And it was this one
p278_352 Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow
p278_353 My view has now completely changed
p278_354 Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items
p278_355 He was at school in Devon
p278_356 Finally came the moment of truth
p278_357 This might seem like an outrageous assertion
p278_358 A crucial moment has arrived
p278_359 In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations
p278_360 Three years ago he would have been
p278_361 But we welcome this document
p278_362 It intends to do so on Wednesday
p278_363 His views are hardly surprising
p278_364 He expected a conclusion by next Thursday
p278_365 The Allies intend to maintain the average
p278_366 We put our bid in last night
p278_367 Their condition is described as satisfactory
p278_368 We're still the only ones in the High Street
p278_369 I was delighted to accept
p278_370 A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry
p278_371 Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance
p278_372 The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year
p278_373 From our point of view, the player is free to leave
p278_374 Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months
p278_375 He must have seen the movie
p278_376 The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals
p278_377 The major championships will always have a special place
p278_378 That is a break with tradition
p278_379 This decision is a farce
p278_380 Is it worth it ?
p278_381 Does it matter ?
p278_382 How do you take them away ?
p278_383 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p278_384 After the match, do you ?
p278_385 Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited
p278_386 In due course the deal was done
p278_387 This remains the party's policy
p278_388 They will fight for everything
p278_389 Tomorrow will be a different game entirely
p278_390 The team hadn't been picked
p278_391 One-third of the places are already taken
p278_392 I always knew she was funny
p278_393 The marshall at the turn was great
p278_394 There isn't the seriousness of other businesses
p278_395 They have not got anyone
p278_396 The law would appear to be on our side
p278_397 It has happened for generations
p278_398 The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful
p278_399 The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account
p278_400 There's still no-one like him
p278_401 They know it'll be fantastic
p278_402 This big issue is whether it can be enforced
p278_403 Clark is back on top form
p278_404 I had a fortunate war
p278_405 We must improve our relations with government
p278_406 The Cabinet is split over the issue
p278_407 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p278_408 That is the ultimate revenge
p278_409 The next few months will tell
p278_410 A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire
p279_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p279_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p279_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p279_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p279_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p279_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p279_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p279_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p279_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p279_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p279_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p279_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p279_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p279_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p279_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p279_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p279_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p279_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p279_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p279_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p279_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p279_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p279_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p279_025 It's a relief that a decision has finally been made
p279_026 He said the matter had been neglected in the past
p279_027 The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic
p279_028 They should be so lucky
p279_029 Is this accurate?
p279_030 I am not interested in the money, it is the principle
p279_031 There's a story, too
p279_032 People love to see this stuff
p279_033 He took me on a tour of the wards
p279_034 Horses are drawn by ballot
p279_035 It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies
p279_036 They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life
p279_037 They're just different
p279_038 Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons
p279_039 Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare
p279_040 President Bush is at war
p279_041 She is believed to be in South Africa
p279_042 I was scared
p279_043 Dancing was her life
p279_044 It will come all right
p279_045 It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside
p279_046 We will push
p279_047 That period was a struggle
p279_048 It is urgent
p279_049 It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract
p279_050 The judge said
p279_051 Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison
p279_052 We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there
p279_053 It's a blessing
p279_054 But it might have done
p279_055 The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids
p279_056 As she explains
p279_057 Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight
p279_058 He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention
p279_059 Life is good
p279_060 We've got a lot of respect for the Lions
p279_061 Here's a clue
p279_062 He had no enemies
p279_063 Sadly, it can't
p279_064 We have not given up hope
p279_065 Gerhard Schroeder was the victor
p279_066 That's the truth
p279_067 They were too hard
p279_068 The problems are a result of that shortfall
p279_069 Art is extra
p279_070 They're appalled by that
p279_071 George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision
p279_072 Scotland had great assets
p279_073 He was popular
p279_074 Have a look at our accounts
p279_075 It is like a river running by my home
p279_076 The end result is precisely the same
p279_077 It seemed so personal
p279_078 Painful, but only because it's true
p279_079 He had been a singer
p279_080 I've been there
p279_081 They do not work for Glasgow City Council
p279_082 Both sides have been hit by injury
p279_083 She died in hospital two hours later
p279_084 Is there a new way forward?
p279_085 It works for us
p279_086 It is a time bomb
p279_087 This is the way things should be handled
p279_088 The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning
p279_089 It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats
p279_090 Florida is the pivotal state in the nation
p279_091 Lord Levy said he started life with nothing
p279_092 They lived for their children
p279_093 Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today
p279_094 Yet, it worked
p279_095 This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager
p279_096 It is an old family habit
p279_097 Until you hit the big games
p279_098 The peace process will be buried!
p279_099 The oil companies would be asked to contribute
p279_100 We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football
p279_101 The selection process is still at a very early stage
p279_102 However, we have not come to any conclusions
p279_103 After that time, the market itself will set the prices
p279_104 I see no need for change
p279_105 That would be unlawful
p279_106 I didn't play well last year
p279_107 Before the game we went for a pint
p279_108 They will want to perform well
p279_109 For these people, the ruling is very welcome
p279_110 I don't have many friends
p279_111 O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place
p279_112 Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin
p279_113 I was angry
p279_114 This is a step backwards
p279_115 We have to look at everything before we make any final decision
p279_116 This film will be totally awesome
p279_117 My office is bare
p279_118 Does this mean
p279_119 They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed
p279_120 That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships
p279_121 Who would have?
p279_122 Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland
p279_123 We work on the same level
p279_124 You can spend money on housing
p279_125 I felt very strongly that England should have it
p279_126 Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership
p279_127 I'm so angry
p279_128 Child abuse is a dreadful thing
p279_129 Despite the result, it was still a great moment
p279_130 Some of the characters will not be played by humans
p279_131 Well, you can have a tree
p279_132 We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence
p279_133 Because it's a waste of time for both sides
p279_134 It will be too hot
p279_135 The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council
p279_136 I am now unemployed
p279_137 You've got to be vigilant
p279_138 It's perfectly feasible
p279_139 There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music
p279_140 This represents a tough game for us
p279_141 That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano
p279_142 And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life
p279_143 We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football
p279_144 Is that Titanic?
p279_145 That could mean the difference between life and death in action
p279_146 It is like a football team
p279_147 I am just trying to do my job
p279_148 They did very well
p279_149 You know the type
p279_150 In each case they were a goal down
p279_151 The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough
p279_152 A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar
p279_153 It was the same at Twickenham
p279_154 We also enjoyed a lot of support
p279_155 He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused
p279_156 This latter point is hugely important
p279_157 I am very happy with life
p279_158 These days are long gone
p279_159 It is an attitude of mind
p279_160 But we have not heard a thing from Diego
p279_161 Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks
p279_162 As, indeed, they would be
p279_163 I have got a wife to feed
p279_164 We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors
p279_165 Tell it like it was?
p279_166 It is not too late to get on board
p279_167 It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful
p279_168 By then, however, both men were already in the US
p279_169 Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw
p279_170 Nobody did in those days
p279_171 My life has been destroyed
p279_172 His team management was protective
p279_173 Is Saddam a threat?
p279_174 We wanted it left for a wee while
p279_175 But the petrol station does not get the benefit
p279_176 It is not either national standards or local control
p279_177 The clarity is vital
p279_178 The hotel was now for sale
p279_179 I drove the ball well
p279_180 That has been the easy part
p279_181 Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked
p279_182 No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death
p279_183 Government will intervene
p279_184 We knew nothing about it
p279_185 Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted
p279_186 It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait
p279_187 It's a joke
p279_188 Does this matter?
p279_189 It just came into my head that day
p279_190 My main concern is that public health is not put at risk
p279_191 It was an odd affair, in many respects
p279_192 It is tough, but possible
p279_193 We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome
p279_194 The procedure is the same in all cases
p279_195 Neither side would reveal the details of the offer
p279_196 The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date
p279_197 It was typical
p279_198 Our strategy is straightforward
p279_199 There would appear to be no motive for the attack
p279_200 I have a cold
p279_201 Tommy is not a problem
p279_202 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p279_203 The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday
p279_204 He had suffered a heart attack
p279_205 The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster
p279_206 I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling
p279_207 Some realism was needed about time, resources and management
p279_208 There was no rescue
p279_209 We're not seeing an image of the person, he said
p279_210 I don't want to use it
p279_211 This gives a financial incentive to switch
p279_212 The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn
p279_213 The road was closed for several hours
p279_214 That is an important part of our role
p279_215 Twaddle is a case in point
p279_216 I am delighted for Simon
p279_217 By hard work, is the answer
p279_218 I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery
p279_219 However, Dundee deserved to win this game
p279_220 His death was a tragic accident
p279_221 He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda
p279_222 He's a nice guy
p279_223 But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition
p279_224 A career as a doctor is on hold
p279_225 I am immensely sad
p279_226 I'd never seen a play about me
p279_227 It is a gamble
p279_228 My neighbours are horrified
p279_229 At the time, he was a living legend
p279_230 Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern
p279_231 They are the innocent victims
p279_232 Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final
p279_233 Broke the birdie record
p279_234 Police later said the scheme would end in November
p279_235 It is set in Paris
p279_236 They should come forward
p279_237 It is not an option, but a policy requirement
p279_238 Sadly, it sounds as if it is
p279_239 You take a risk
p279_240 It's too much work
p279_241 The court was shown a video of the house on that day
p279_242 It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet
p279_243 He will go a long way
p279_244 We did not compete with any other local farmer
p279_245 The scene is about this?
p279_246 It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak
p279_247 We will need to study the report before any decision is taken
p279_248 He's a lovely young man
p279_249 There will be widespread support on all sides
p279_250 This year I understood
p279_251 This is the culture change in medicine
p279_252 He said he intended to push for a judicial review
p279_253 He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather
p279_254 For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique
p279_255 It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit
p279_256 That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective
p279_257 This is a big club
p279_258 Blair is very positive at European Councils
p279_259 they fail to engage
p279_260 People should not become complacent
p279_261 The work between the musicians and the fire is very important
p279_262 The warning is timely
p279_263 Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention
p279_264 Blood samples were taken
p279_265 It looks as though he will be right
p279_266 Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races
p279_267 I am totally horrified by the sentence
p279_268 It's very nice
p279_269 It left me with a sadness
p279_270 It was an easy decision to come here
p279_271 It is the same in Sweden
p279_272 That could be in place by next year
p279_273 Things can change
p279_274 A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes
p279_275 The script was funny
p279_276 They seem to get away with it
p279_277 She looked so young
p279_278 It happens from time to time
p279_279 For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray
p279_280 They expect the minister to ensure that commitment is honoured
p279_281 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p279_282 I intended to look for another club on loan
p279_283 You've got to have both sides
p279_284 The attacker died in the crash
p279_285 It was a virus
p279_286 Maloney is an engaging talent
p279_287 Who will perform?
p279_288 It's like a high school play
p279_289 It was hopeless
p279_290 I asked for a positive response and I was given one
p279_291 She said she could not believe that they had run away
p279_292 He wrote the letter two days before he died
p279_293 It changed my life
p279_294 These figures are truly awful
p279_295 He should have won
p279_296 Sunday's game was not a trial
p279_297 Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen
p279_298 What has altered?
p279_299 Graeme was prepared
p279_300 I thought it was my only chance
p279_301 One was a lawyer
p279_302 The most important thing is to get a programme for government
p279_303 They are wrong
p279_304 This is a war over our home
p279_305 In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge
p279_306 Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well
p279_307 It was entirely justified
p279_308 They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house
p279_309 It's certainly different
p279_310 The letters are going out today
p279_311 I did not name it
p279_312 The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him
p279_313 Special measures were needed
p279_314 It is all credit to them today
p279_315 They were fantastic
p279_316 Craig is a major concern for us
p279_317 My body is clearly capable
p279_318 I came into this world with nothing
p279_319 The airport was even different
p279_320 Hopefully, he will get a lucky break
p279_321 But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament
p279_322 He got the same story
p279_323 They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden
p279_324 He was then replaced by Ross
p279_325 She did not attend the courtroom
p279_326 You have to be able to deal with all age groups
p279_327 In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times
p279_328 Was this element always there?
p279_329 They haven't got a hope
p279_330 He did a good job
p279_331 I'm so pleased the show has won a prize
p279_332 It is so unfair
p279_333 It will be very, very tight
p279_334 That is the very reason why it was so vital
p279_335 In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre
p279_336 The composer will conduct
p279_337 It's always nice to play on Centre Court
p279_338 Alex Ferguson is the same
p279_339 The boat was fantastic
p279_340 I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil
p279_341 Like his acting, it was an accident
p279_342 A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry
p279_343 You need a licence to run a pub
p279_344 The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police
p279_345 The salary changes are long overdue
p279_346 The decision is an absolute disgrace
p279_347 It is horrible
p279_348 The pressure is on Celtic in the main
p279_349 I kept going for her
p279_350 He has seen the past
p279_351 Hartley should know
p279_352 We are looking for perfection
p279_353 It's not pretty, but it's effective
p279_354 It's that sort of night
p279_355 He could make it
p279_356 Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world
p279_357 I lost my head
p279_358 For one veteran, the memories remain vivid
p279_359 It was a double tragedy for the family
p279_360 He put some colour into Scottish history
p279_361 Well, the big day has arrived
p279_362 So there, we won
p279_363 By that time, however, it was already too late
p279_364 Breaking new ground is also very rewarding
p279_365 There is no signature
p279_366 Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter
p279_367 There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging
p279_368 He's delighted, too, with the new premises
p279_369 He has the edge
p279_370 Again, we were lucky
p279_371 He denied the charge
p279_372 Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning
p279_373 It has been a lovely family occasion
p279_374 That's the name of the game, though
p279_375 YOU thought it was a headache
p279_376 Family liaison officers are now working to support the family
p279_377 We have to reduce the number of plastic bags
p279_378 It doesn't always work that way
p279_379 I'm pleased about one thing
p279_380 We try to keep it right
p279_381 The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia
p279_382 It's like a basketball
p279_383 Stewart will travel with some confidence
p279_384 I can lead by example
p279_385 He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response
p279_386 He is on the wrong side
p279_387 It will probably take me just days to spend it
p279_388 I was in jail for five years
p279_389 It will take place in July
p279_390 However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work
p279_391 The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions
p279_392 I never won a penny throughout my career
p279_393 His remarks appear to have had an effect
p279_394 He's already made history
p279_395 So I did
p279_396 You ask the question
p279_397 Not because they want to sing about something
p279_398 You make the choice
p279_399 I have been in good form for the last two years
p279_400 A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September
p279_401 Nobody even knew it had happened
p279_402 What would be the point?
p279_403 The weekly average was three hours
p279_404 Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling
p279_405 The visual arts committee took this decision in December
p279_406 Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra
p282_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p282_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p282_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p282_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p282_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p282_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p282_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p282_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p282_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p282_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p282_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p282_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p282_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p282_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p282_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p282_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p282_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p282_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p282_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p282_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p282_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p282_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p282_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p282_025 But it failed
p282_026 Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports
p282_027 Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format
p282_028 However, the following year the cancer returned
p282_029 Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected
p282_030 This is the window
p282_031 He was jailed for five years
p282_032 Help is needed
p282_033 Then, suddenly, they weren't
p282_034 It is marvellous
p282_035 Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night
p282_036 However, they continued in their pursuit of victory
p282_037 They're just different
p282_038 It was clear
p282_039 Indeed, he does
p282_040 People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background
p282_041 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p282_042 Dancing was her life
p282_043 The ambition this year is to improve on last
p282_044 It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned
p282_045 They want to be entertained
p282_046 It's the only thing
p282_047 You had better believe it
p282_048 Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion
p282_049 On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options
p282_050 A neighbour said
p282_051 It is bizarre
p282_052 There is no reason at all
p282_053 In essence, the teaching profession has a choice
p282_054 Every aspect of our play was first class
p282_055 Our people are ready
p282_056 Here's a clue
p282_057 I was lost
p282_058 For the meantime, though, the signs are good
p282_059 My fitness was very poor
p282_060 Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident
p282_061 It is unique
p282_062 I expect a rapid response
p282_063 It happened so quickly
p282_064 That's the truth
p282_065 It seems to have worked
p282_066 This is the first step
p282_067 And if he hadn't become a musician?
p282_068 There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music
p282_069 I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset
p282_070 But I've won both ways
p282_071 Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p282_072 Robin Williams is very subdued
p282_073 They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide
p282_074 It could take some time
p282_075 We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy
p282_076 I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier
p282_077 It is a job creation scheme
p282_078 The party is up for it
p282_079 People must remain vigilant
p282_080 Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits
p282_081 What has changed?
p282_082 I will miss him
p282_083 He is in the queue
p282_084 I first met him last summer
p282_085 What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p282_086 Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games
p282_087 It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats
p282_088 They lived for their children
p282_089 The city council is a major property owner in the area
p282_090 Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today
p282_091 Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile
p282_092 We are on the path of change
p282_093 This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit
p282_094 Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party
p282_095 Yet, it worked
p282_096 He's been hit by it
p282_097 I love the Dome
p282_098 I wish I had put on a brighter tie
p282_099 However, we have not come to any conclusions
p282_100 It is a love affair
p282_101 Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe
p282_102 They make a selective perception process
p282_103 Two of the team became ill
p282_104 That would be unlawful
p282_105 I don't want to use it
p282_106 Oil embargo endorsed
p282_107 It was an adventure
p282_108 Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday
p282_109 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p282_110 According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland
p282_111 I was fighting for my life, I thought
p282_112 Is that right?
p282_113 He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter
p282_114 It's a shame
p282_115 It was the eighties
p282_116 It is so sad
p282_117 Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin
p282_118 The mood is upbeat
p282_119 It is rubbish
p282_120 Who would be a referee?
p282_121 That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships
p282_122 We enjoyed it today
p282_123 His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years
p282_124 Here, again, they were denied a voice
p282_125 There were no grounds for his action
p282_126 I'm so angry
p282_127 She really suffered for her art
p282_128 It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation
p282_129 It is not a U-turn
p282_130 No production was achieved
p282_131 I am now unemployed
p282_132 We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider
p282_133 It plans to return to this field
p282_134 We work well together
p282_135 The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday
p282_136 We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties
p282_137 Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison
p282_138 I was dead
p282_139 I don't know the full story
p282_140 Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray
p282_141 She died at her home
p282_142 He realises his mistake
p282_143 He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative
p282_144 Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition
p282_145 I was awful
p282_146 Who would have?
p282_147 He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context
p282_148 It is not just about pay
p282_149 It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment
p282_150 There was a substantial explosion
p282_151 I was stunned
p282_152 The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight
p282_153 The weather forecast isn't good
p282_154 They have not been named
p282_155 She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers
p282_156 My Dad is a hero
p282_157 For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon
p282_158 Words were not required
p282_159 The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids
p282_160 Life becomes a song
p282_161 Well, he should know
p282_162 Was this element always there?
p282_163 These days are long gone
p282_164 I'd love to be like Peter
p282_165 I've put my own money into this project
p282_166 It has to be now
p282_167 Military action is the only option we have on the table today
p282_168 I was in the train station overnight
p282_169 We have a budget in March
p282_170 We should do everything at a stroke
p282_171 You had to go and see him
p282_172 It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate
p282_173 In a way he was
p282_174 They might be broken, but they are not defeated
p282_175 Blair's response was weak
p282_176 As we worked
p282_177 We are the gateway to justice
p282_178 I have the first six months of next season to prove myself
p282_179 The goals were good
p282_180 Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman
p282_181 It's an idea
p282_182 It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area
p282_183 They need to look after themselves
p282_184 I saw military vehicles in the distance
p282_185 Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general
p282_186 Does this matter?
p282_187 Our team is just so young
p282_188 Suddenly, the rugby world had changed
p282_189 However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery
p282_190 It caused a lot of upset
p282_191 But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections
p282_192 We speak about the performance
p282_193 It is a farce
p282_194 Peace was won
p282_195 It's a fact
p282_196 I came home by ambulance
p282_197 It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions
p282_198 Is that success?
p282_199 I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February
p282_200 Who will pay for this?
p282_201 It's all about money, money, money
p282_202 Sadly, it can't
p282_203 It was worth a photograph
p282_204 After that time, the market itself will set the prices
p282_205 We have an election in eight days
p282_206 Feel the heat?
p282_207 The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors
p282_208 Twaddle is a case in point
p282_209 It had all been arranged
p282_210 IT S all change at Kilmarnock
p282_211 Work has started
p282_212 The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers
p282_213 On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football
p282_214 The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument
p282_215 Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E
p282_216 This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers
p282_217 Then another one came
p282_218 The loss of a company to the industry is a blow
p282_219 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p282_220 Clearly, the stakes are high
p282_221 It's a question of creating a future awareness
p282_222 I'd never seen a play about me
p282_223 It's not before time
p282_224 I didn't play too well in the third quarter
p282_225 I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision
p282_226 I would like to focus on a structure and a target
p282_227 Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern
p282_228 My wife and family are the support system
p282_229 Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable
p282_230 Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party
p282_231 We are so proud
p282_232 The role was a knockout, but really difficult
p282_233 Of course I was tempted
p282_234 It's quite a line-up!
p282_235 On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence
p282_236 The minister is the engineer
p282_237 I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay
p282_238 It is hard won
p282_239 Our policy is clear
p282_240 I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday
p282_241 The scene is about this?
p282_242 In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify
p282_243 My son was too young to die
p282_244 In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win
p282_245 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p282_246 It was a hit
p282_247 Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults
p282_248 That could be in place by next year
p282_249 For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique
p282_250 It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit
p282_251 That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective
p282_252 they fail to engage
p282_253 It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland
p282_254 One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning
p282_255 They must play for each other
p282_256 However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint
p282_257 There's not much money in cycling
p282_258 This court has made an order which has not been observed
p282_259 George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks
p282_260 That review will look at management across the sector as a whole
p282_261 He has not created a Festival resource
p282_262 He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant
p282_263 He was also married with two children
p282_264 It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players
p282_265 Charles Kennedy had an effective outing
p282_266 Our objective is to tackle poverty
p282_267 One knows the feeling
p282_268 Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry
p282_269 The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline
p282_270 She has fallen in love with Scotland, however
p282_271 She failed in her action
p282_272 He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry
p282_273 She looked so young
p282_274 In fact, he was talking about the survival business
p282_275 It's so awful
p282_276 Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that
p282_277 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p282_278 You've got to have both sides
p282_279 Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished
p282_280 Dialogue is the key
p282_281 They have shown a great desire and attitude
p282_282 She is an expert on medical ethics
p282_283 Who will perform?
p282_284 This is a national crisis
p282_285 Who did the recruiting?
p282_286 She is really magic
p282_287 That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients
p282_288 I was the sheep
p282_289 I was brought up in a mining background
p282_290 In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat
p282_291 Nothing is safe
p282_292 But it's a subtle process
p282_293 One was a lawyer
p282_294 The most important thing is to get a programme for government
p282_295 A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election
p282_296 They are wrong
p282_297 Eight new hospitals are set to be built
p282_298 There were no passengers on board
p282_299 It could work
p282_300 This is a war over our home
p282_301 Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well
p282_302 There's no evidence he was ever there
p282_303 You should be
p282_304 However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart
p282_305 The letters are going out today
p282_306 Is there on his hands?
p282_307 The Premier League has been a huge success
p282_308 Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision
p282_309 She is very distinctive
p282_310 We have got to get the points from this one
p282_311 You may have a short memory
p282_312 Henman has been warned
p282_313 We are in the end game
p282_314 It will work
p282_315 I came into this world with nothing
p282_316 They will certainly be visible from every house in our area
p282_317 Our message was inclusive
p282_318 But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament
p282_319 Feel the air, the space
p282_320 Is there a new way forward?
p282_321 We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence
p282_322 The figures are bad, but not that bad
p282_323 Later in the day he was forced to explain his position
p282_324 However, they will only be found in the wild
p282_325 The same things will happen with GM foods
p282_326 Three years ago he would have been
p282_327 That's not eviction because he is not a tenant
p282_328 Locally, too, the MP is under fire
p282_329 Two people were interviewed
p282_330 I've got no secret
p282_331 We lost our composure towards the interval, he said
p282_332 This is a friendly match?
p282_333 A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference
p282_334 This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required
p282_335 They should take their mobile phones
p282_336 He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal
p282_337 A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company
p282_338 Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday
p282_339 She is free
p282_340 Both of those promises have already been honoured
p282_341 Tyson is overwhelmed
p282_342 In addition, it was in breach of natural justice
p282_343 Yet he left a few days later
p282_344 It was only a matter of time before someone was killed
p282_345 As, indeed, they would be
p282_346 It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage
p282_347 Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors
p282_348 To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential
p282_349 The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning
p282_350 That would help
p282_351 My husband was angry
p282_352 Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported
p282_353 And he laughs
p282_354 He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer
p282_355 This is a club on the rise
p282_356 It's not pretty, but it's effective
p282_357 Their time has gone
p282_358 He could make it
p282_359 The death rates are still as high
p282_360 Now, though, he has an incentive
p282_361 Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again
p282_362 This big issue is whether it can be enforced
p282_363 It took about an hour for the gas to clear
p282_364 It is a simple equation
p282_365 By that time, however, it was already too late
p282_366 It was a funny game
p282_367 There wasn't a goal
p282_368 Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter
p282_369 Colour was at the core of his life
p282_370 He's delighted, too, with the new premises
p286_001 Please call Stella
p286_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p286_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p286_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p286_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p286_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p286_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p286_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p286_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p286_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p286_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p286_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p286_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p286_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p286_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p286_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p286_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p286_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p286_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p286_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p286_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p286_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p286_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p286_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p286_025 Smoking is also very important
p286_026 We must convince the citizens
p286_027 I am pretty careful with money
p286_028 Because we do not need it
p286_029 It is about control of our economy
p286_030 She has fallen in love with Scotland, however
p286_031 She is employed on short-term contracts
p286_032 They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life
p286_033 I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah
p286_034 Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons
p286_035 Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism
p286_036 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p286_037 Costs have got to be controlled
p286_038 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p286_039 The staff are as good as any staff in the city
p286_040 It is serious - but not that serious
p286_041 Among them are many criminals
p286_042 He looks like an Afghan
p286_043 He will need that machine
p286_044 Her body was found about four miles from the car
p286_045 I had come back from London
p286_046 Pulled a huge number of viewers
p286_047 I had trouble with the producers
p286_048 Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer
p286_049 We are certainly talking about many millions
p286_050 We are a new department
p286_051 He also presented You Bet!
p286_052 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p286_053 How are you, sir ?
p286_054 So is that it, then ?
p286_055 Do I have a favourite ?
p286_056 People come to see the Highlands
p286_057 The outcome of their game isn't the important thing
p286_058 We have not given up hope
p286_059 The cuts were made within an hour of each other
p286_060 We would have concerns about suspension
p286_061 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p286_062 We have to keep our clients
p286_063 It seems to have worked
p286_064 They have to come up with a solution
p286_065 Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London
p286_066 It is a great feeling right now
p286_067 It's not covered by the insurance
p286_068 Robin Williams is very subdued
p286_069 It wasn't possible to relax
p286_070 We speak about the performance
p286_071 Then followed a bout of flu
p286_072 Both sides have been hit by injury
p286_073 That would be too easy
p286_074 I want the Commonwealth and European titles
p286_075 It is a job creation scheme
p286_076 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p286_077 Even the one she loved
p286_078 Talk of a crisis is absurd
p286_079 Their mandate is to target inflation
p286_080 England were ahead until two minutes into injury time
p286_081 It's all going to clear the debt
p286_082 This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst
p286_083 Petrol prices were widely blamed
p286_084 He has been a success this year
p286_085 The error appeared in a warrant
p286_086 We have to offer value for money
p286_087 Florida is the pivotal state in the nation
p286_088 It's so hard to shift
p286_089 Potions said he would drive
p286_090 Theatre is not a museum
p286_091 Why do it otherwise ?
p286_092 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p286_093 So, did she meet him ?
p286_094 So what is the campaign about ?
p286_095 And does it ?
p286_096 Are you from the rugby ?
p286_097 Had I heard ?
p286_098 Last weekend was extremely frustrating
p286_099 Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll
p286_100 The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation
p286_101 It really was an unusual award
p286_102 I cannot believe this decision
p286_103 The allegations were still under investigation, he added
p286_104 Until you hit the big games
p286_105 The outsourcing deal will take effect in September
p286_106 We will deal with the refugees
p286_107 The oil companies would be asked to contribute
p286_108 We could not get any possession
p286_109 They must be on commission
p286_110 He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels
p286_111 It's not a holiday time for football players
p286_112 He was forced to quit
p286_113 But I know the course
p286_114 Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked
p286_115 We should recognise that others have done a good job
p286_116 In the end we made too many errors
p286_117 But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant
p286_118 We needed financial backing to get it off the ground
p286_119 Our offer represents an attractive price for the business
p286_120 The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest
p286_121 It is an impressive record
p286_122 I'm pleased to get through the opening match
p286_123 I have learned from him
p286_124 I will never change our policy on paying appearance money
p286_125 The situation is not easy, but we will prevail
p286_126 Maybe this battle has been
p286_127 In addition, investor choice is reduced
p286_128 It isn't a happy memory
p286_129 The firm also has a construction division
p286_130 Harry Potter has lost his magic
p286_131 Then again, we could have
p286_132 They will remember this victory for a while
p286_133 Structural changes were also required
p286_134 It was a good game to watch
p286_135 His job was not advertised
p286_136 However, the problem is the timing
p286_137 They keep the atmosphere in mind
p286_138 Which can happen any time
p286_139 It is the latter which has prompted the warning
p286_140 The abuse of elderly people was appalling
p286_141 My life has changed a lot
p286_142 He said to give a local injection
p286_143 The manager's position was obviously included in that review
p286_144 The first half was depressing
p286_145 Tiger is not the norm
p286_146 He will get his chances
p286_147 They could use a boost
p286_148 What happened in that game ?
p286_149 Are you going to win ?
p286_150 Was it the wife ?
p286_151 Why change it ?
p286_152 What do we want to do that for ?
p286_153 At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived
p286_154 Anyone can do the sums
p286_155 The striker needed attention before he could resume
p286_156 He's not a Celtic man
p286_157 It opens the door to the Champions League
p286_158 No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday
p286_159 There's only one team in Ayrshire
p286_160 The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday
p286_161 Behind him was his brother
p286_162 She had gone to the Catholic school
p286_163 The family kept away from me
p286_164 She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers
p286_165 We will turn the corner
p286_166 My Dad is a hero
p286_167 It should never have happened
p286_168 We did what we had to do
p286_169 The bank was now involved
p286_170 Full back was a bit of the unknown
p286_171 It's never great to finish second
p286_172 Adventure is the champagne of life
p286_173 That would open the gates of hell
p286_174 Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo
p286_175 Further growth will be funded from cash flow
p286_176 The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups
p286_177 They could not match it
p286_178 One season, they might do well
p286_179 The second aspect was the fear of failure
p286_180 First and foremost, the game is entirely different
p286_181 People should not become complacent
p286_182 This championship is different from the other majors
p286_183 I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal
p286_184 I'm pretty happy with the way I played
p286_185 At the top level, the salaries are far too high
p286_186 Playing in Europe is the benchmark
p286_187 Each case is treated on merit
p286_188 We have a long way to go this week
p286_189 It appears that it was just a genuine mistake
p286_190 His son is a local legend
p286_191 Our destiny is in our own hands
p286_192 They are only interested in attacking Labour
p286_193 They need to look after themselves
p286_194 Miller was every bit as happy
p286_195 It could be done by experts and lawyers
p286_196 I cannot say too much about them
p286_197 Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval
p286_198 The new owners wanted the club to go in a different direction
p286_199 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p286_200 I'm interested in interesting work
p286_201 We represent a wide range of society
p286_202 It caused a lot of upset
p286_203 Does the name matter ?
p286_204 how do you get it back ?
p286_205 What are you not good at ?
p286_206 I think, therefore I am ?
p286_207 Who was she ?
p286_208 Motorists will buy passes in advance
p286_209 It's very difficult to find a buyer
p286_210 The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date
p286_211 Mr Blair was ready for him
p286_212 Because he was born in England
p286_213 We've had an enjoyable adventure
p286_214 It comes from reflection or thinking
p286_215 It was a moment of madness
p286_216 This will be our new beginning
p286_217 They have the cash and the fire power
p286_218 Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon
p286_219 We should all be grateful
p286_220 The early physical reports were clear
p286_221 The result is utterly compelling
p286_222 The sisters also became the top two players in the world
p286_223 Stephen has never considered the question of compensation
p286_224 The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office
p286_225 This will take several weeks
p286_226 Scotland will play its part
p286_227 The move follows a review of the Singapore
p286_228 Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match
p286_229 This gives a financial incentive to switch
p286_230 His injury was completely random
p286_231 And they haven't taken the foot off the gas
p286_232 It will affect their work
p286_233 These things have not happened by accident
p286_234 They are difficult awards to decide
p286_235 I am considered a teenager
p286_236 He must get to know himself
p286_237 There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal
p286_238 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p286_239 Laura is an investment banker
p286_240 You could feel the heat
p286_241 The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions
p286_242 I am not ready for Lennox Lewis
p286_243 I have spoken to the skipper
p286_244 The output price index in December was unchanged on November
p286_245 The scientific debate is dead
p286_246 This would include the GM food industry
p286_247 A small number of new jobs will also be created
p286_248 They are the innocent victims
p286_249 She will attend in July
p286_250 He does not much like the Liberal Democrats
p286_251 She claimed the day was for young people
p286_252 Pensions are a long-term investment
p286_253 The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high
p286_254 Customers would then be consulted over any changes
p286_255 That will be a decision for BBC Scotland
p286_256 Three weeks later, he resigned
p286_257 A succession of managers in the opera company resigned
p286_258 There were no reports of casualties
p286_259 This fact is supported by audience research
p286_260 Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter
p286_261 And it was this one
p286_262 Kingfisher can afford to wait
p286_263 Chairman Sir Alistair Grant will remain on the board as deputy chairman
p286_264 Defensive stocks attracted some interest
p286_265 We have no information on Iraq
p286_266 His is a global perspective
p286_267 Either way, the investor retains the premium
p286_268 Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed
p286_269 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p286_270 I should think so, too
p286_271 No production contract is yet in sight
p286_272 Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland
p286_273 The capital costs are modest
p286_274 Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me
p286_275 This idea has been around for four years
p286_276 And they were being paid ?
p286_277 was everything done to save people ?
p286_278 What was the matter for concern ?
p286_279 Do I think about them often ?
p286_280 Is it in the right place ?
p286_281 The result was a crisis for the global financial system
p286_282 That will be a problem for later
p286_283 Blair is very positive at European Councils
p286_284 They must play for each other
p286_285 These figures are truly terrible
p286_286 Analysts had a mixed reaction to the numbers
p286_287 There's not much money in cycling
p286_288 The stage was set for a showdown
p286_289 It wasn't about one player
p286_290 That view has not altered
p286_291 Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK
p286_292 Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate
p286_293 Frankly, we should all have such problems
p286_294 It was an easy decision to come here
p286_295 Similar measures are expected in England and Wales
p286_296 Everything will fall into place, it should be fine
p286_297 He's been here on numerous occasions
p286_298 Further expansion has been achieved in Germany and Italy
p286_299 That has been described in some quarters as nonsense and arrogance
p286_300 You have to expect this type of thing
p286_301 However, he will have his work cut out defending his title
p286_302 It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday
p286_303 Gerhard Schroeder was the victor
p286_304 The circumstances have changed since last year
p286_305 I intended to look for another club on loan
p286_306 We feel very comfortable in this international environment
p286_307 It was simply no contest
p286_308 I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh
p286_309 Motherwell have no such good fortune
p286_310 But it has been an amazing experience
p286_311 We would hope to make progress on that next year
p286_312 Our season is not finished
p286_313 The rescue package is public money
p286_314 The effect was almost magical
p286_315 I was there five months ago
p286_316 I am a retailer by nature
p286_317 And that culture is everywhere In Dublin
p286_318 Holland won by five wickets
p286_319 It's unlikely to be renewed
p286_320 He has taken the title for the last two years
