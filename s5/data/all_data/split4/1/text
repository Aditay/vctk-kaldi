p225_001 Please call Stella
p225_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p225_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p225_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p225_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p225_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p225_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p225_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p225_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p225_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p225_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p225_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p225_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p225_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p225_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p225_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p225_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p225_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p225_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p225_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p225_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p225_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p225_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p225_025 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p225_026 How are you, sir ?
p225_027 So is that it, then ?
p225_028 Do I have a favourite ?
p225_029 What do we do ?
p225_030 People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background
p225_033 It's really no great surprise, because the price difference is so much
p225_035 A hostile bid is prevented for another nine months
p225_036 It was a close call
p225_037 In fact, they are the future of investment
p225_038 Diving is no part of football
p225_039 However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials
p225_040 You'd better believe it
p225_044 It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council
p225_045 People were determined to change the Government in the last election
p225_046 No details of the talks were given
p225_049 I have learned from him
p225_051 We are committed to the ban
p225_052 Already, he has been a tremendous influence in the dressing room
p225_053 I have made that offer
p225_054 Four other charges were dropped
p225_056 Clearly, it can go either way
p225_057 However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result
p225_058 However, the problem is the timing
p225_059 But retail banking would be run from Halifax
p225_060 Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses
p225_061 Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world
p225_062 I was very pleased with them today, though
p225_063 Both sides have been hit by injury
p225_064 It could take some time
p225_065 There is no pressure on us
p225_066 It is a job creation scheme
p225_067 Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help
p225_070 That is bound to happen
p225_071 He is in the queue
p225_072 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p225_073 So, did she meet him ?
p225_081 I had no intention of misleading anyone
p225_082 That view is held by many others within the industry
p225_083 Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll
p225_084 He is delighted, and he has every right to be
p225_086 In fact, he should never have been in the field
p225_089 Officers recovered a second body in the area
p225_090 I did not have a bet on myself
p225_092 There is a contract in existence for Allan
p225_094 That's as it should be
p225_103 Everyone deserves to share in this success
p225_104 His is a success story by any standard
p225_108 Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants
p225_109 That might help a bit
p225_110 Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor
p225_111 It isn't a happy memory
p225_113 The big issue for us is the review
p225_114 I told him I was a long time ago
p225_115 Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots
p225_116 Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits
p225_117 We have no influence on the Government's policy on the euro
p225_118 We suffered a lot for seven years
p225_120 The industry is not well organised
p225_121 You get a lot for your money
p225_122 I didn't feel under any pressure
p225_123 It is the latter which has prompted the warning
p225_124 As for the warning, it was not needed
p225_126 The squad is too small
p225_127 It is a common problem
p225_128 Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg
p225_131 Another High Street retailer was not so lucky
p225_133 I think he's the favourite
p225_135 We have seen a copy of the report
p225_136 But the Commission is on a collision course with the Government
p225_141 Drugs are used a lot at the fishing
p225_142 Well, you can have a tree
p225_143 Russell did not appeal the committee's decision
p225_144 She will do for me
p225_145 Why change it ?
p225_147 Does the name matter ?
p225_149 Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme
p225_150 But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company
p225_151 Nothing has been put into action
p225_152 The weather forecast isn't good
p225_153 We have a clean bill of health
p225_156 I would like to see the figures for the second quarter
p225_157 He was asked to quit
p225_158 Inside, the atmosphere was quiet
p225_159 Neither side can win this war
p225_165 The Internet is no substitute for customer service
p225_166 Like last month, it is simply too early to make a call
p225_169 Irvine said his company was intent on supporting the Scottish dairy industry
p225_171 The report was criticised by the Scottish Consumer Council
p225_172 Nobody did in those days
p225_173 But the story of the play is worth a play in itself
p225_174 He was a big influence on our decision to make this show
p225_175 At that point, the structure of the board was changed
p225_176 Treatment is not an issue with these people
p225_177 The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton
p225_179 They know no other way
p225_182 We are just glad to be alive
p225_191 People will ask about us
p225_192 However, this idea is never developed
p225_193 It's very difficult to find a buyer
p225_195 It is hard to tell
p225_196 I think, therefore I am ?
p225_197 Who was she ?
p225_199 And they were being paid ?
p225_200 It looked like a river
p225_201 The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts
p225_202 The occasion was the New Labour conference in Brighton last year
p225_203 They have the cash and the fire power
p225_208 You are a great player
p225_210 Scotland will play its part
p225_211 He added that he was very sad about O Neill
p225_212 After that nothing could save him
p225_218 We used to live with dignity in our country
p225_219 They did not attack the themes of the book
p225_220 He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland
p225_221 It's all change at Kilmarnock
p225_222 In each case they were a goal down
p225_223 The police have an awful lot to explain
p225_224 He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda
p225_225 It is good for our team
p225_235 I always felt that I was in control of the match
p225_236 That will be the criteria for the future
p225_237 Frankly, we were lucky to get second
p225_238 Paterson can afford to be generous
p225_239 In fact, he is not even in the squad for the game
p225_240 We are in the hat
p225_241 Well, they were the unlucky ones
p225_242 The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days
p225_243 The irony was not lost
p225_244 What was the matter for concern ?
p225_248 Does that put pressure on us ?
p225_253 Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars
p225_254 The problem was a social problem
p225_257 My son was too young to die
p225_258 We were not allowed to go to help them
p225_264 That should be the subject matter of a public debate
p225_265 It was a Budget for jobs for Scotland
p225_266 No other vehicle was involved in the crash
p225_268 I realised I was lucky to have it
p225_273 He has not created a Festival resource
p225_274 We have not reached the point of no return
p225_275 Similar measures are expected in England and Wales
p225_276 He will make an excellent chief inspector
p225_277 It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence
p225_279 Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise
p225_280 Sadly, the revival could not be sustained
p225_281 They were not at the property yesterday
p225_282 It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow
p225_285 We have to break that cycle
p225_286 I wanted to change the formula
p225_287 She said the charity would continue to monitor the case
p225_289 Motherwell have no such good fortune
p225_290 Scotch beef is badly missed
p225_291 We would hope to make progress on that next year
p225_293 It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players
p225_294 However, we had no failures in our side
p225_295 Clydesdale Bank declined to comment
p225_296 It goes back a long way
p225_297 Innocent people have a right to live in safety
p225_298 It was deployed in the Gulf War
p225_299 They had to learn to work from the consumer back
p225_300 I can hardly believe it
p225_301 I must do something about it
p225_302 Three hours later, the man was free
p225_303 And it had been a marvellous occasion
p225_305 Cast Away now on general release
p225_308 I thought his speech was a disgrace
p225_309 Are they free ?
p225_310 What are they for ?
p225_312 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p225_314 We believe the world has too many refugees already
p225_315 The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand
p225_316 It is beyond the government to deal with this tragedy
p225_317 At the moment, it is very difficult to know
p225_318 The problem was he thought you were a big man
p225_319 There's still a bit to go
p225_320 We have a good healthy debate
p225_322 Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources
p225_323 It is a court case
p225_324 There is no plan B
p225_325 The court was shown a video of the house on that day
p225_326 He will go a long way
p225_328 It is just a tax on employment
p225_329 There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh
p225_330 We are a peaceful people
p225_331 Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure
p225_332 It's difficult to predict the future
p225_334 Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed
p225_335 We are in the end game
p225_336 I came into this world with nothing
p225_337 But they have the sound
p225_346 It wasn't a flight of fancy
p225_347 Boy is the town a mess
p225_348 Does it matter ?
p225_349 How do you take them away ?
p225_350 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p225_351 After the match, do you ?
p225_352 He was then replaced by Ross
p225_353 THE pain was almost too much to bear
p225_354 This action reflects a slump in bookings
p225_355 Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal
p225_356 I said he was set to retire
p225_357 It is a sign of hope
p225_358 The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk
p225_359 But we welcome this document
p225_363 There is The Beautiful Game to write
p225_365 You did not see it
p225_366 It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet
p226_001 Please call Stella
p226_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p226_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p226_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p226_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p226_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p226_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p226_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p226_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p226_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p226_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p226_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p226_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p226_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p226_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p226_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p226_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p226_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p226_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p226_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p226_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p226_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p226_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p226_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p226_025 He has not been named
p226_026 That's no bad thing
p226_027 They should have a major rethink about the event for next year
p226_028 Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed
p226_029 We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent
p226_030 Because we do not need it
p226_031 This is the window
p226_032 I was an athlete
p226_033 From that day on we started to look for another full back
p226_034 Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist
p226_036 It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise
p226_037 It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies
p226_039 It has failed
p226_040 It was clear
p226_041 It is not for any other purpose
p226_042 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p226_043 Is there a new way forward?
p226_044 Mexico City was a wonderful experience
p226_045 This represents a tough game for us
p226_046 Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison
p226_047 We need to chat
p226_048 It's a blessing
p226_049 But it might have done
p226_050 Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland
p226_051 It has been a horrible, horrible time
p226_052 It is the whole package
p226_053 He had no enemies
p226_054 I got a great response from the players, as I had expected
p226_055 However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress
p226_056 For the meantime, though, the signs are good
p226_057 It's the big omission
p226_058 Next league matches Celtic
p226_059 She's a spy!
p226_060 It is unique
p226_061 It is not a process which can be completed overnight
p226_062 This is a scheme that has a lot of potential
p226_063 It's a real challenge
p226_064 It is not great art
p226_065 You do not change overnight
p226_066 Art is extra
p226_067 It's a matter of balance
p226_068 Scotland had great assets
p226_069 I've spent a lot of time on buses
p226_070 There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music
p226_071 I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset
p226_072 Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise
p226_073 The script was funny
p226_074 You need a trademark
p226_075 Painful, but only because it's true
p226_076 Help is needed
p226_077 Tommy is not a problem
p226_078 There could be a way back
p226_079 Neither it is
p226_080 The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow
p226_082 It is a terrible place
p226_083 It works for us
p226_084 I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February
p226_085 It can be halted
p226_086 This is the way things should be handled
p226_088 Detection is often difficult
p226_089 He seems to be pleased with the picture
p226_090 New Zealand rugby is totally different
p226_091 Someone who cares
p226_092 It's just awful
p226_093 It's never too late
p226_094 Every time I play I do not understand their reaction
p226_095 That will come after the game on Saturday
p226_096 However, it did not end that way
p226_097 We could not get any possession
p226_098 If you could find it
p226_099 He is hungry for success and I am the same
p226_100 They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs
p226_101 It was mayhem
p226_102 I am not willing to say anything about any couple
p226_103 They were outside the circle
p226_104 However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full
p226_105 May not have been at fault?
p226_106 It was some time before she found out he was safe
p226_107 It was a good performance
p226_108 That time is not now, however
p226_109 Oil embargo endorsed
p226_110 Before the game we went for a pint
p226_111 It was an adventure
p226_112 The eye was badly closed on Sunday
p226_113 The Prime Minister was very saddened to hear about this
p226_114 It was really enjoyable on Saturday
p226_115 I did not think about the Ryder Cup
p226_116 It is normal
p226_117 I don't have many friends
p226_118 We have to look at everything before we make any final decision
p226_119 Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee
p226_120 It would not do any harm to reinforce the message
p226_121 Maybe this battle has been
p226_122 Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants
p226_124 This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election
p226_125 She's got to say something
p226_126 It is a delight on every level
p226_127 We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors
p226_128 I felt very strongly that England should have it
p226_129 She has been shot
p226_130 I thought it was a fantastic game
p226_131 I was furious
p226_132 Child abuse is a dreadful thing
p226_133 She really suffered for her art
p226_134 It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation
p226_135 I do not think this family will ever get over this
p226_136 Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't
p226_137 It will be too hot
p226_138 The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk
p226_139 I am now unemployed
p226_140 They made such decisions in London
p226_141 Our intentions are real
p226_142 Government will intervene
p226_143 Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general
p226_144 Police could not say if the two incidents were connected
p226_145 On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door
p226_146 It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions
p226_148 Three penalties were given
p226_149 In this case, the farmer had actually given permission
p226_150 We just had a go
p226_151 We have seen a copy of the report
p226_152 That could mean the difference between life and death in action
p226_153 That group reported just before Christmas
p226_154 Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power
p226_155 It's an issue that will have to be tackled
p226_156 The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday
p226_157 Alain Baxter did not have long to speak on Friday
p226_158 We will turn the corner
p226_159 The weather affected the other two games in Fife
p226_160 They should stop the bombing
p226_161 These days are long gone
p226_162 It is an attitude of mind
p226_163 I've learned from my mistakes
p226_164 They say that vital evidence was not heard in court
p226_165 We have to move forward
p226_166 However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands
p226_167 They will do their own thing
p226_168 It is too much for me
p226_169 Nobody did in those days
p226_171 A helpline number is published at the end of this article
p226_172 It became a book by itself
p226_173 His team management was protective
p226_174 It's quite a routine
p226_175 It is not either national standards or local control
p226_176 If that's the case, he will struggle
p226_177 I took the gun
p226_178 Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked
p226_179 No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death
p226_180 I have the first six months of next season to prove myself
p226_181 I've been there
p226_183 I have no sympathy with her at all
p226_184 It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait
p226_185 It is not fair
p226_186 It just came into my head that day
p226_187 I had a train to catch
p226_188 Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval
p226_189 The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment
p226_190 Suddenly, the rugby world had changed
p226_191 Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender
p226_192 People will ask about us
p226_193 The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date
p226_194 It is a case of taking a risk
p226_195 It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work
p226_197 There was no option
p226_198 Is that it?
p226_199 We live by the rule of law
p226_200 Is that success?
p226_201 The service from the other players was super
p226_202 They are in the euro
p226_203 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p226_204 The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office
p226_205 I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling
p226_206 Some realism was needed about time, resources and management
p226_207 It's a mixture of everything
p226_208 I don't want to use it
p226_209 Now, it's all right
p226_210 It's like a garage
p226_211 But I am a worried man
p226_212 They like being on the front pages of the newspapers
p226_213 Feel the heat?
p226_214 I'm pleased about one thing
p226_215 I am delighted for Simon
p226_216 His third goal was superb
p226_217 It's not ideal
p226_218 I was so nervous
p226_219 I might come back
p226_220 For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon
p226_221 Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement
p226_223 But we have not heard a thing from Diego
p226_224 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p226_225 A career as a doctor is on hold
p226_226 At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher
p226_227 Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval
p226_228 I am immensely sad
p226_229 I'd never seen a play about me
p226_230 The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia
p226_231 The track is currently covered in snow
p226_232 My wife and family are the support system
p226_233 Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable
p226_234 Stewart will travel with some confidence
p226_235 Police later said the scheme would end in November
p226_236 It is set in Paris
p226_237 It is not an option, but a policy requirement
p226_238 Hospitals are for the ill
p226_239 It would still have been a good film, but very different
p226_240 She is well balanced
p226_241 They are all bright and different
p226_242 It's only fair
p226_243 We lost our composure towards the interval, he said
p226_244 It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet
p226_245 I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday
p226_246 His body was never found
p226_247 We did not compete with any other local farmer
p226_248 I was shocked
p226_249 I should think so, too
p226_251 There's the mix
p226_252 There will be widespread support on all sides
p226_253 I was never going to play against Scotland
p226_254 At the end of the day, one has to be careful
p226_255 That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective
p226_256 Blair is very positive at European Councils
p226_257 Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites
p226_258 That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match
p226_259 Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom
p226_260 It is a mark of respect from the inmates
p226_261 He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention
p226_262 Today we can say that a new era has begun
p226_263 I would have the hammer in the crowd
p226_264 This court has made an order which has not been observed
p226_265 The work between the musicians and the fire is very important
p226_266 The warning is timely
p226_267 George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks
p226_268 That decision is for the British Parliament and people
p226_269 They are never here
p226_270 We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter
p226_271 He was popular
p226_272 Frankly, we should all have such problems
p226_273 It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players
p226_274 She has every confidence in his performance of his duties
p226_276 It's a way of life
p226_278 I feel pretty good
p226_279 In essence, the teaching profession has a choice
p226_280 He has a wealth of experience
p226_281 It happens from time to time
p226_283 He looked very sharp
p226_284 Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident
p226_285 It was a virus
p226_286 Yet, it worked
p226_287 Who will perform?
p226_288 The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together
p226_289 This is a national crisis
p226_290 Scotland were beaten again
p226_291 It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence
p226_292 It goes back a long way
p226_293 He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained
p226_294 The results are sometimes contentious
p226_295 He should have won
p226_296 If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world
p226_297 There's a pause
p226_298 The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland
p226_299 There was no hint of scandal
p226_300 I thought it was my only chance
p226_301 However, the snow was welcomed by some
p226_302 Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman
p226_303 One was a lawyer
p226_304 Our task is to complete the picture
p226_305 A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election
p226_306 We believe the world has too many refugees already
p226_307 The whole matter is somewhat in the air
p226_308 This is a war over our home
p226_309 In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge
p226_310 It is no country for a man or woman of letters
p226_311 I was concerned with the way they tried to justify his actions
p226_312 It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing
p226_313 The minister is the engineer
p226_314 I did not name it
p226_315 It was a question of patience
p226_316 The whole region is in shock
p226_317 It's about my time as a guitarist
p226_318 Kids are terrible
p226_319 Craig is a major concern for us
p226_320 The home team had an amazing start
p226_321 My body is clearly capable
p226_322 Referees are easy targets
p226_323 He said she was mad
p226_324 We are in the end game
p226_325 I am very happy to be here
p226_326 The airport was even different
p226_327 We do the same
p226_328 That's the law of the land
p226_329 But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament
p226_330 The weekly average was three hours
p226_331 Donald was his friend
p226_332 I am so upset
p226_333 It was no secret that I wanted to sign him
p226_334 On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research
p226_335 The boat was fantastic
p226_336 It is a time bomb
p226_337 I'd like to take the plunge
p226_338 Later in the day he was forced to explain his position
p226_339 My view has now completely changed
p226_340 You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel
p226_341 In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times
p226_342 Three years ago he would have been
p226_343 I'm so pleased the show has won a prize
p226_344 He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French
p226_345 They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance
p226_346 But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party
p226_347 It was his conclusion that they were generally in good condition
p226_348 Look at the witnesses
p226_349 He's been the key to everything
p226_350 That is the very reason why it was so vital
p226_351 This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required
p226_352 His contract was then not renewed
p226_353 A report is the first step in a criminal case in India
p226_354 That is a break with tradition
p226_355 A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company
p226_356 She is free
p226_357 I kept going for her
p226_358 You must have a government and a good civil service
p226_359 He's very explosive
p226_360 No other job in world football can compare to this one
p226_361 Our numbers are small
p226_362 Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported
p226_363 Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment
p226_364 This is a club on the rise
p226_365 I have got a wife to feed
p226_366 It's not pretty, but it's effective
p226_367 Equity declined to comment
p226_368 All the investment is possible through the public sector
p226_369 He took over our lives
p226_370 Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world
p227_001 Please call Stella
p227_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p227_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p227_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p227_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p227_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p227_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p227_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p227_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p227_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p227_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p227_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p227_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p227_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p227_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p227_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p227_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection in the sun's rays by the rain
p227_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p227_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p227_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p227_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p227_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p227_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p227_025 Meetings will also remain private
p227_026 Movement has to take place
p227_027 I feel I did not have enough time
p227_028 We will look into it
p227_029 This is a central issue
p227_030 Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy
p227_031 The Premier League has been a huge success
p227_032 There, you were just a body
p227_033 It is not for any other purpose
p227_034 President Bush is at war
p227_035 I became a widow overnight
p227_036 Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man
p227_037 This represents a tough game for us
p227_038 She hopes to study in Britain one day
p227_039 Among them are many criminals
p227_040 Yesterday, he was busy in his office
p227_041 He looks like an Afghan
p227_042 It will concentrate on the Thames Valley
p227_043 I'd come back from London
p227_044 If I was a woman
p227_045 He was a home referee
p227_046 There was no safety net
p227_047 The casting of her husband was an accident
p227_048 We have to look beyond the very short term
p227_049 I expect a rapid response
p227_050 That is very hard, alone
p227_051 The motive for the shooting was not known
p227_052 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p227_053 Four other charges were dropped
p227_054 I could not do it
p227_055 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p227_056 How are you, sir ?
p227_057 So is that it, then ?
p227_058 Do I have a favourite ?
p227_059 What do we do ?
p227_060 The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow
p227_061 There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement
p227_062 They have to come up with a solution
p227_063 We will pay their bills
p227_064 Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued
p227_065 He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture
p227_066 Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses
p227_067 I have proved that in the past
p227_068 He had been a singer
p227_069 They would now be able to look forward with confidence
p227_070 Then followed a bout of flu
p227_071 Both sides have been hit by injury
p227_072 Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator
p227_073 It is a terrible place
p227_074 Even the one she loved
p227_075 After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction
p227_076 There may be reasons for it
p227_077 I first met him last summer
p227_078 Last week, he was taken into hospital
p227_079 Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games
p227_080 Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat
p227_081 By then, he was walking on water
p227_082 We have to offer value for money
p227_083 They lived for their children
p227_084 Potions said he would drive
p227_085 The latter is due to be finished in February
p227_086 This is a complex and detailed report
p227_087 The outsourcing deal will take effect in September
p227_088 We will deal with the refugees
p227_089 You might not make it
p227_090 It is open season on the Old Firm
p227_091 That is the important thing
p227_092 For once, you should believe the hype
p227_093 Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons
p227_094 Their attitude is all wrong
p227_095 You are like an animal
p227_096 No, the equipment is extra
p227_097 The following are the principal provisions
p227_098 It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials
p227_099 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p227_100 I had a fortunate war
p227_101 I did not see any reason to change the captain
p227_102 Saddam Hussein is a devil
p227_103 It was never a starter
p227_104 And the match was not too bad, either
p227_105 Such actions are rarely popular
p227_106 It is safe in our hands
p227_107 Then came the farewell to Europe
p227_108 It is much as it has been described
p227_109 You can spend money on housing
p227_110 That admission is not surprising
p227_111 Not a great deal has changed in the last decade
p227_112 It has removed a bit of guilt
p227_113 However, we have to be cautious
p227_114 But we could only help a handful of people
p227_116 It is just a tax on employment
p227_117 This should begin in October
p227_118 My life has changed a lot
p227_119 We did what we had to do
p227_120 Why do it otherwise ?
p227_121 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p227_122 So, did she meet him ?
p227_123 So what is the campaign about ?
p227_124 And does it ?
p227_125 You've got to be vigilant
p227_126 We are amazed that the current trading figures were so weak
p227_127 Any success would have been an improvement
p227_128 On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door
p227_129 And I have some advice for my old friend
p227_130 He is a great addition to our team
p227_131 However, this move is dependent upon the sale of the existing site
p227_132 I felt he was excellent
p227_133 They could use a boost
p227_134 It is a vicious circle
p227_135 We could easily have lost that game
p227_136 This is a limited market
p227_137 Our position is quite simple
p227_138 Five minutes later, the home team were back in front
p227_139 Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes
p227_140 Drugs are used a lot at the fishing
p227_141 He's not a Celtic man
p227_142 It opens the door to the Champions League
p227_143 So I got a blood test
p227_144 It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment
p227_145 These men are a part of India
p227_146 Like the others, he was arrested
p227_147 There's only one team in Ayrshire
p227_148 It was deployed in the Gulf War
p227_149 That was the difference between the sides
p227_150 Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment
p227_151 I was shaking on the blocks
p227_152 She had gone to the Catholic school
p227_153 This year, this month, will be special for Torrance
p227_154 The strong pound also took its toll
p227_155 It was a funny feeling
p227_156 I'd love to be like Peter
p227_157 Adams is surely worth a chance
p227_158 It is difficult to say
p227_159 He was in great spirits
p227_160 Seven people were later detained by police
p227_161 They want to see him
p227_162 Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo
p227_163 Nobody did in those days
p227_164 There is no signature on this document
p227_165 We've made a couple of albums
p227_166 What happened in that game ?
p227_167 Are you going to win ?
p227_168 Was it the wife ?
p227_169 Why change it ?
p227_170 What do we want to do that for ?
p227_171 The people are the hero
p227_172 One season, they might do well
p227_173 They made such decisions in London
p227_174 The second aspect was the fear of failure
p227_175 The jury is still out
p227_176 But he has a lifeline
p227_177 The expansions will be financed by the Clydesdale Bank
p227_178 I'm just going to hit the shot
p227_179 It makes no influence on the public
p227_180 That will apply to both sets of fans
p227_181 I think it's a good sign
p227_183 I have spoken to head office
p227_184 Well, you can have a tree
p227_186 They bought the property four years ago
p227_187 He is believed to live in Britain
p227_188 We've just had it confirmed
p227_189 A copy of the report will be sent to them
p227_190 This is the time to use it
p227_191 You know the sort of thing
p227_192 They were seriously after him
p227_193 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p227_194 Trading conditions have not been that bad
p227_195 I'm interested in interesting work
p227_196 It will be reviewed in The Herald tomorrow
p227_197 The force is with them
p227_198 If the director is with you
p227_199 He made no order on costs
p227_200 I guess I was lucky, though
p227_201 This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds
p227_203 It was served by sheriff officers
p227_204 This will be our new beginning
p227_205 They have the cash and the fire power
p227_206 My heart is with the artist
p227_207 That might mean another delay
p227_208 However, it is not as simple as this
p227_209 The sanctions are about collective punishment
p227_210 This is a holy place
p227_211 Does the name matter ?
p227_212 how do you get it back ?
p227_213 What are you not good at ?
p227_214 I think, therefore I am ?
p227_215 Who was she ?
p227_216 You have caught a serial killer
p227_217 It seemed a moving and fitting tribute
p227_218 The move follows a review of the Singapore
p227_219 They make a selective perception process
p227_220 There is no quick fix
p227_222 They have known the hard times
p227_223 That might help a bit
p227_226 I'm just a regular person
p227_227 My daughter is an adult
p227_228 He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland
p227_229 It's just a normal life
p227_230 He must get to know himself
p227_231 And the World Cup has not even begun
p227_232 He remains a main board director of Royal
p227_233 The fight is under way
p227_235 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p227_236 They all made the European Ryder Cup team
p227_237 We can certainly build on this
p227_238 William Hague delighted his party
p227_239 There is a world of difference
p227_240 We played them off the pitch
p227_241 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p227_242 I can't wait to meet him
p227_243 My wife and family are the support system
p227_244 They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house
p227_245 It is the voice of the survivors
p227_246 She died in middle age
p227_247 It is set in Paris
p227_248 You will have seen the adverts
p227_249 It is possible to be too good
p227_250 Moreover, it must be for all sports
p227_251 They were in the wrong place at the wrong time
p227_252 The irony was not lost
p227_253 Three weeks later, he resigned
p227_254 It is a court case
p227_255 It might be sad, but it's a fact
p227_256 She took them for a term
p227_257 Kingfisher can afford to wait
p227_258 Nato was not a love affair
p227_259 We lost our composure towards the interval, he said
p227_260 Hospitals and school building will go ahead
p227_261 You can feel at home in China
p227_262 Our decision making was poor
p227_263 The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK
p227_264 The baby deserves the credit
p227_265 And they were being paid ?
p227_266 Was everything done to save people ?
p227_267 What was the matter for concern ?
p227_268 Do I think about them often ?
p227_269 Is it in the right place ?
p227_270 Did he trip ?
p227_271 In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win
p227_272 I should think so, too
p227_273 No production contract is yet in sight
p227_274 The capital costs are modest
p227_275 This is no reflection on Rangers
p227_276 I told you I was ill
p227_277 I can't get a job
p227_278 That could be in place by next year
p227_279 On the contrary they stand to gain
p227_280 Blair is very positive at European Councils
p227_281 I rejected the idea of a separate residence
p227_282 It does not work that way in Scottish football
p227_283 Every one is a winner
p227_284 There's not much money in cycling
p227_285 This court has made an order which has not been observed
p227_286 Not many companies can say that these days
p227_287 They can leave at any time
p227_288 You get a lot for your money
p227_289 As for Scotland, we can just enjoy the moment
p227_290 It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight
p227_291 It was an easy decision to come here
p227_292 Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years
p227_293 He ran into immediate problems with local people and police
p227_294 But the plot is not the point
p227_295 It was never a free kick
p227_296 My body is a wreck
p227_297 It's called the Supreme Court for a reason
p227_298 She has fallen in love with Scotland, however
p227_299 She failed in her action
p227_300 Stephen will get his first cap
p227_301 It's hard to see it
p227_302 Her appeal is to be heard this week
p227_303 We have to be very, very careful
p227_304 The partnership was set up during the summer
p227_305 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p227_306 It is an amazing response
p227_307 Size is not the issue
p227_308 He will address the nation this evening
p227_309 We have the easy part
p227_310 We are not increasing the number
p227_311 I'm looking for work in Bath and back home in Scotland
p227_312 They do not reflect the quality of the brand
p227_313 It could well be military
p227_314 And that culture is everywhere in Dublin
p227_315 His job was not advertised
p227_316 This is a big step up
p227_317 It goes back a long way
p227_318 The weather forecast isn't good
p227_319 We have a clean bill of health
p227_320 In that case, the children were not missing
p227_321 I have got a victim
p227_322 The judge was really nice
p227_323 If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world
p227_324 McNaughton was not so sure
p227_326 The dealer is on notice
p227_327 It is hoped to complete the merger in the summer
p227_328 The party lasted all night
p227_329 He would help me with the form
p227_330 There's still a bit to go
p227_331 I'm not worried about the critics
p227_332 I would do away with the dress code
p227_333 It is so easy to be negative
p227_334 What form did that take ?
p227_335 Are they free ?
p227_336 What are they for ?
p227_337 Is there a waiting list ?
p227_338 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p227_339 So what happens next ?
p227_340 The result was a crisis for the global financial system
p227_341 I am not obsessed with sex
p227_342 Have a look at this lot
p227_343 That decision will be made over the next couple of days
p227_344 Public opinion was split on the proposal
p227_345 The king is delighted by the honour
p227_347 I've got a sense of humour, too
p227_348 In the old days, it was easy
p227_349 I came into this world with nothing
p227_350 This is a trend which will be encouraged
p227_351 There will have to be a full inquiry
p227_352 There was no time scale
p227_353 In his absence, the council adopted the change
p227_354 Whether this return was too soon
p227_355 The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable
p227_356 They were the acts of men
p227_357 Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items
p227_358 Of course, we want to go home
p227_359 I am very interested in the subject
p227_360 He is not very big, either
p227_361 A report is expected next month
p227_363 We are encouraged by the news
p227_364 Had this been common practice ?
p227_365 What do they want us to do ?
p227_366 Is it worth it ?
p227_367 Does it matter ?
p227_368 A crucial moment has arrived
p227_369 Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side
p227_370 We need to be prepared
p227_371 Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground
p227_372 His views are hardly surprising
p227_373 The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper
p227_374 It has been made to entertain
p227_375 It is a stroke of genius
p227_376 Italy was just behind the US
p227_377 It was forced to divert
p227_378 Alex Ferguson is the same
p227_379 I would like to focus on a structure and a target
p227_380 We are still getting over it
p227_382 This will impact on us
p227_383 From our point of view, the player is free to leave
p227_384 He is in the queue
p227_385 The salary changes are long overdue
p227_386 I do not like to lose
p227_387 I am a member of the Labour Party staff
p227_388 There is no deal as yet
p227_389 In due course the deal was done
p227_390 Celtic were pleased to help
p227_391 They will fight for everything
p227_392 That's not like us at all
p227_393 You have to rely on each other
p227_394 I wanted to go out on a high
p227_395 I felt the head was very like me
p227_396 It is a terrible equation
p227_397 They have not got anyone
p227_398 I can hardly believe it
p227_399 How do you take them away ?
p227_400 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p227_401 After the match, do you ?
p227_402 Persuaded to change his mind
p228_001 Please call Stella
p228_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p228_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p228_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p228_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p228_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p228_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p228_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p228_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p228_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p228_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p228_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p228_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p228_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p228_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p228_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p228_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p228_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p228_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p228_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p228_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p228_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p228_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p228_025 It's nice to hear
p228_026 So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic
p228_027 Because we do not need it
p228_028 There's a story, too
p228_029 I feel I did not have enough time
p228_030 Life was like a timetable
p228_031 He took me on a tour of the wards
p228_032 We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude
p228_033 However, they continued in their pursuit of victory
p228_034 In both cases, I suffered a fiasco
p228_035 It was clear
p228_036 The problem is the pitch
p228_037 Indeed, he does
p228_038 President Bush is at war
p228_039 She is believed to be in South Africa
p228_040 My whole life has changed
p228_041 On this showing, they should stick with the lads
p228_042 No meaningful response was issued
p228_043 It is urgent
p228_044 Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion
p228_045 Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison
p228_046 We need to chat
p228_047 We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there
p228_048 The Scottish Parliament is also looking at similar measures
p228_049 But it might have done
p228_050 Hopefully, it will be built by next year
p228_051 Mary Archer is almost too clever
p228_052 He looks like an Afghan
p228_053 Here's a clue
p228_054 It had been in place since last July
p228_055 However, he will now have to wait for his chance to impress
p228_056 That's the day job
p228_057 For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray
p228_058 That's the truth
p228_059 That is very hard, alone
p228_060 He will now seek to sell his shares in the club
p228_061 Four other charges were dropped
p228_062 They're appalled by that
p228_063 There was a battle there
p228_064 Scotland had great assets
p228_065 It's that kind of place
p228_066 Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London
p228_067 An appeal against the sentence was dismissed the following year
p228_068 And if he hadn't become a musician ?
p228_069 He is a young man with a new deal
p228_070 Charles Kennedy had an effective outing
p228_071 The script was funny
p228_072 Try to save us
p228_073 Sounds like The Sixth Sense ?
p228_074 Painful, but only because it's true
p228_075 They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide
p228_076 It's all I can do
p228_077 They do not work for Glasgow City Council
p228_078 Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision
p228_079 I had my suspicions
p228_081 People must remain vigilant
p228_082 Today she has been released
p228_083 That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog
p228_084 He liked to give the impression of being a hard man
p228_085 But she might be
p228_086 Nothing is yet confirmed
p228_087 Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished
p228_088 It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats
p228_089 Every time I play I do not understand their reaction
p228_090 Now the system is right behind us
p228_091 Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile
p228_092 Today I couldn't run on it
p228_093 However, it did not end that way
p228_094 This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit
p228_095 Safety was also an issue
p228_096 It is an old family habit
p228_097 I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party
p228_098 The oil companies would be asked to contribute
p228_099 It is annoying
p228_100 We could not get any possession
p228_101 I love the Dome
p228_102 We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football
p228_103 I wish I had put on a brighter tie
p228_104 He is hungry for success and I am the same
p228_105 Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights
p228_106 Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults
p228_107 It is a good day for the coalition
p228_108 A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury
p228_109 However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full
p228_110 We're not seeing an image of the person, he said
p228_111 Meanwhile, the Scottish Consumer Council yesterday offered support for the new Bill
p228_112 We have an election in eight days
p228_113 For these people, the ruling is very welcome
p228_114 They will want to perform well
p228_115 The eye was badly closed on Sunday
p228_116 However, they will only be found in the wild
p228_117 It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials
p228_118 Further protests are likely
p228_119 It's in his blood
p228_120 I don't want to use the term
p228_121 The picture is the same across Scotland
p228_122 Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals
p228_123 It is so sad
p228_124 It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option
p228_125 Until the weekend he was minister for social justice
p228_126 Who would be a referee ?
p228_127 They've got to account for it
p228_128 It is a delight on every level
p228_129 An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks
p228_130 Here, again, they were denied a voice
p228_131 I felt very strongly that England should have it
p228_132 It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged
p228_133 This plan is an agenda for action
p228_134 Despite the result, it was still a great moment
p228_135 Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince
p228_136 Offered the gold medal, he declined
p228_137 Who will attend ?
p228_138 We had a reunion last week
p228_139 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p228_140 We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties
p228_141 I was the last man to touch the ball
p228_142 He was in a great deal of pain
p228_143 Nobody in the world can get away from him
p228_144 She hopes to study in Britain one day
p228_145 Wallace was a prisoner of war
p228_146 I think he's the favourite, no question
p228_147 Who would be right ?
p228_148 It is difficult for Ali
p228_149 Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition
p228_150 Had she enjoyed the experience ?
p228_151 That should do it
p228_152 That could mean the difference between life and death in action
p228_153 It is not just about pay
p228_154 I am just trying to do my job
p228_155 It opens the door to the Champions League
p228_156 The home side didn't stand a chance
p228_157 The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous
p228_158 The weather forecast isn't good
p228_159 The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday
p228_160 There's a sense of excess in the novel
p228_161 We also enjoyed a lot of support
p228_162 It was by the numbers
p228_163 I was in daily contact
p228_164 The weather affected the other two games in Fife
p228_165 Alex has been a huge influence on the club
p228_166 It was so new, so exciting
p228_167 But we have not heard a thing from Diego
p228_168 I've put my own money into this project
p228_169 Eight months later, he was dead
p228_170 They say that vital evidence was not heard in court
p228_171 We have to move forward
p228_172 By then, however, both men were already in the US
p228_173 We have to sort it out ourselves
p228_174 The post will be unpaid
p228_175 As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead
p228_176 And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers
p228_177 We've made a couple of albums
p228_178 They might be broken, but they are not defeated
p228_179 Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling
p228_180 One season, they might do well
p228_181 However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service
p228_182 It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned
p228_183 The hotel was now for sale
p228_184 I drove the ball well
p228_185 I took the gun
p228_186 We knew nothing about it
p228_187 They will run a mile
p228_188 It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait
p228_189 Mr Marshall is expected to join the council of Europe
p228_190 Miller was every bit as happy
p228_191 I put the drawing down
p228_192 The most important thing is to get a programme for government
p228_193 It was an odd affair, in many respects
p228_194 Florida is the pivotal state in the nation
p228_195 We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome
p228_196 We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner
p228_197 The procedure is the same in all cases
p228_198 But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections
p228_199 The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date
p228_200 I wanted to put myself on the line
p228_202 It's the same old story
p228_203 It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council
p228_204 Is that success ?
p228_205 I have a cold
p228_206 They are in the euro
p228_207 Ferguson should take note
p228_208 I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February
p228_209 Who will pay for this ?
p228_210 They've got three-quarters of the way
p228_211 He had suffered a heart attack
p228_212 A deadline is still essential
p228_213 Yet she is still the woman behind the famous man
p228_214 We will give a formal response to the report in due course
p228_215 After that time, the market itself will set the prices
p228_216 That will be vital
p228_217 Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement
p228_218 That is an important part of our role
p228_219 She should not be blamed
p228_220 I had decided to quit the show
p228_221 His third goal was superb
p228_222 It's been a good year
p228_223 The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers
p228_224 He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda
p228_225 Women were mostly notable by their absence
p228_226 The loss of a company to the industry is a blow
p228_227 Clearly, the stakes are high
p228_228 It is a gamble
p228_229 It's so special
p228_230 You take a risk
p228_231 He is severe
p228_232 We just had a go
p228_233 We are in the hat
p228_234 We were a load of rubbish
p228_235 Well, they were the unlucky ones
p228_236 On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence
p228_237 The perception is that we do not care about social issues
p228_238 I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay
p228_239 He claimed the government had lost the plot
p228_240 She was well balanced
p228_241 It's only fair
p228_242 He says that he is no different from any other man
p228_243 You can feel at home in China
p228_244 In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify
p228_245 It is a policy which has the full support of the minister
p228_246 Washington is consumed by the crisis
p228_247 He's a lovely young man
p228_248 It was a hit
p228_249 He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic
p228_250 I can't get a job
p228_251 He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather
p228_252 It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit
p228_253 That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective
p228_254 Certainly, in terms of league position, we must be favourites
p228_255 That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match
p228_256 One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning
p228_257 Is that a serious question ?
p228_258 They are real
p228_259 They must play for each other
p228_260 I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean
p228_261 His contract was then not renewed
p228_262 He thought he had a month to cross the street
p228_263 Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday
p228_264 That decision is for the British Parliament and people
p228_265 Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races
p228_266 Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public
p228_267 It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players
p228_268 I was rubbish
p228_269 He's been here on numerous occasions
p228_270 Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry
p228_271 It's a way of life
p228_272 The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline
p228_274 It is not a process which can be completed overnight
p228_275 They were too hard
p228_276 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p228_277 Russian officials have not determined the cause of the accident
p228_278 All options are open
p228_279 He will address the nation this evening
p228_280 We want to see the maximum of change
p228_281 Mr Campbell received a phone call
p228_282 He was obviously very genuine
p228_283 She said she could not believe that they had run away
p228_284 It changed my life
p228_285 The songs are just so good
p228_286 I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission
p228_287 Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen
p228_288 It became a book by itself
p228_289 The home was now under new management
p228_290 Graeme was prepared
p228_291 Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman
p228_292 He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters
p228_293 Our task is to complete the picture
p228_294 They are wrong
p228_295 It is no country for a man or woman of letters
p228_296 They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house
p228_297 You are the glory
p228_298 It's certainly different
p228_299 A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe
p228_300 We want to play at the worlds
p228_301 We have waited a long time for this
p228_302 Is there on his hands ?
p228_303 This wasn't the way it was supposed to be
p228_304 It's not even finished
p228_305 We are a peaceful people
p228_306 Kids are terrible
p228_307 The problems began a long time ago
p228_308 This film will be totally awesome
p228_309 He said she was mad
p228_310 There was some merit in that
p228_311 I am very happy to be here
p228_312 We do the same
p228_313 In his absence, the council adopted the change
p228_315 It's not long enough
p228_316 Inside, the atmosphere was quiet
p228_317 It was no secret that I wanted to sign him
p228_318 He was then replaced by Ross
p228_319 Is that an issue ?
p228_320 My first concern is for the safety of the public
p228_321 Robert is a special talent
p228_322 A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry
p228_323 You have to be able to deal with all age groups
p228_324 There was no option
p228_325 The same things will happen with GM foods
p228_326 It is a sign of hope
p228_327 Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side
p228_328 It has moved on in the last week
p228_329 The train was on time
p228_330 It is so unfair
p228_331 He has to learn
p228_332 But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party
p228_333 I've got no secret
p228_334 Tiger is the exception
p228_335 A great deal has been achieved
p228_336 It was forced to divert
p228_337 In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre
p228_338 This is a friendly match ?
p228_339 I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil
p228_340 He's a genius
p228_341 They should take their mobile phones
p228_342 It is not like working for a living
p228_343 It's the last thing on my mind
p228_344 The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police
p228_345 He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal
p228_346 That is a break with tradition
p228_347 She is free
p228_348 Everyone was in tears
p228_349 You must have a government and a good civil service
p228_350 As, indeed, they would be
p228_351 No other job in world football can compare to this one
p228_352 I expected these kind of questions
p228_353 It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives
p228_354 He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer
p228_355 It's not pretty, but it's effective
p228_356 Equity declined to comment
p228_357 He later became a respected High Court judge
p228_358 The play is based on a real-life event
p228_359 We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy
p228_360 The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland
p228_361 He put some colour into Scottish history
p228_362 It took about an hour for the gas to clear
p228_363 I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself
p228_364 It is a simple equation
p228_365 So there, we won
p228_366 But I managed
p228_367 By that time, however, it was already too late
p228_368 I am not willing to say anything about any couple
p228_369 There is no signature
p228_370 It's a record label, not a form of music
p228_371 It became a national network
p229_001 Please call Stella
p229_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p229_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p229_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p229_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p229_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p229_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p229_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p229_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p229_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p229_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p229_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p229_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p229_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p229_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p229_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p229_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p229_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p229_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p229_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p229_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p229_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p229_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p229_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p229_025 Johnson was pretty low
p229_026 He said the matter had been neglected in the past
p229_027 It's nice to hear
p229_028 Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format
p229_029 I have a theory
p229_030 It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract
p229_031 So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic
p229_032 Because we do not need it
p229_033 And we have a singer
p229_034 A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes
p229_035 It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does
p229_036 I'd like to continue that record
p229_037 However, they continued in their pursuit of victory
p229_038 In both cases, I suffered a fiasco
p229_039 They're just different
p229_040 Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack
p229_041 It is not for any other purpose
p229_042 He did not know his daughter
p229_043 People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background
p229_044 I was scared
p229_045 It will come all right
p229_046 But it took a lot of bottle
p229_047 But it is all by design
p229_048 I am just going to go for it
p229_050 We need to chat
p229_051 It is difficult for Ali
p229_052 The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids
p229_053 A recording contract is on the horizon
p229_054 Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland
p229_055 It has been a horrible, horrible time
p229_056 We've got a lot of respect for the Lions
p229_057 She's a spy !
p229_058 What was the main difference ?
p229_059 My mother is a widow
p229_060 And a film maker was born
p229_061 Art is extra
p229_062 Scotland had great assets
p229_063 I've spent a lot of time on buses
p229_064 We should have known
p229_065 It is like a river running by my home
p229_066 Try to save us
p229_067 That was the easy election
p229_068 I was as strong as a horse
p229_069 Ferguson should take note
p229_070 The girls are so lucky to be alive
p229_071 Neither it is
p229_072 She died in hospital two hours later
p229_073 It was chaotic
p229_074 It is a job creation scheme
p229_075 It works for us
p229_076 I've not thought about it
p229_077 Two Israeli cabinet ministers were in the building at the time
p229_078 Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits
p229_079 Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night
p229_080 That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog
p229_081 He seems to be pleased with the picture
p229_082 Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money
p229_083 Someone who cares
p229_084 He can do everything
p229_085 By then, he was walking on water
p229_086 It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats
p229_087 Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives
p229_088 They lived for their children
p229_089 It is a lifeline
p229_090 However, it did not end that way
p229_091 We must look forward
p229_092 It is an old family habit
p229_093 Well, the big day has arrived
p229_094 I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party
p229_095 Until you hit the big games
p229_096 The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic
p229_097 The oil companies would be asked to contribute
p229_098 She's got to say something
p229_099 He is hungry for success and I am the same
p229_100 They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs
p229_101 She has so much to offer
p229_102 The court heard he drove into the path of a car
p229_103 It is a good day for the coalition
p229_104 We work on the same level
p229_105 They were outside the circle
p229_106 Two of the team became ill
p229_108 I didn't play well last year
p229_109 Before the game we went for a pint
p229_110 I'm not depressed
p229_111 It is normal
p229_112 He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald
p229_113 I don't have many friends
p229_114 He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter
p229_115 I came to complete
p229_116 I was angry
p229_117 They were behind the wheel
p229_118 The fire was above the hole
p229_119 It's not fair
p229_120 We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail
p229_121 On this showing, they should stick with the lads
p229_122 Maybe this battle has been
p229_123 I'm delighted about that
p229_124 I joined a group
p229_125 It is rubbish
p229_126 Who would be a referee ?
p229_127 It was my own fault and I lost a lot of belief
p229_128 The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment
p229_129 An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks
p229_130 Here, again, they were denied a voice
p229_131 There will be no shortage of quality applicants
p229_132 It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged
p229_133 She really suffered for her art
p229_134 Next season for every manager is a long time away
p229_135 It's an amazing landscape !
p229_136 So the European elections are extremely important
p229_137 He is slightly confused
p229_138 Despite the result, it was still a great moment
p229_139 If not, a deal could take many months
p229_140 They took a risk
p229_141 Government will intervene
p229_142 What will happen then ?
p229_143 We never said that we would walk through the third division
p229_144 On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door
p229_145 This represents a tough game for us
p229_146 I was the last man to touch the ball
p229_147 Nobody in the world can get away from him
p229_148 Three penalties were given
p229_149 In this case, the farmer had actually given permission
p229_150 We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football
p229_151 Who would be right ?
p229_152 We just had a go
p229_153 He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative
p229_154 Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition
p229_155 He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context
p229_156 Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power
p229_157 It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment
p229_158 The home side didn't stand a chance
p229_159 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p229_160 Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment
p229_161 We also enjoyed a lot of support
p229_162 It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse
p229_163 It was by the numbers
p229_164 I knew he was good
p229_165 He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused
p229_166 This year, this month, will be special for Torrance
p229_167 Inside, the atmosphere was quiet
p229_168 Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes
p229_169 Was this element always there ?
p229_170 Alex has been a huge influence on the club
p229_171 A new season has offered a fresh start for both men
p229_172 I will tell you
p229_173 A Labour insider said it was far too close to call
p229_174 It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened
p229_175 Military action is the only option we have on the table today
p229_176 We have to move forward
p229_177 It's that sort of night
p229_178 Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland
p229_179 It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful
p229_180 The post will be unpaid
p229_181 Does that put pressure on us ?
p229_182 It is a memorial
p229_183 It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate
p229_184 They thought they had found a home
p229_185 One season, they might do well
p229_186 Is Saddam a threat ?
p229_187 The home was now under new management
p229_188 He asked me in a tolerance zone
p229_189 The hotel was now for sale
p229_190 I drove the ball well
p229_191 It is the whole package
p229_192 I have the first six months of next season to prove myself
p229_193 We knew nothing about it
p229_194 It is minute
p229_195 Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted
p229_196 Four policemen were wounded
p229_197 What has caused the demise of singing ?
p229_198 Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval
p229_199 Suddenly, the rugby world had changed
p229_200 I've got good news and bad news for you
p229_201 We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner
p229_202 People will ask about us
p229_203 The work between the musicians and the fire is very important
p229_204 Last night was a key episode
p229_205 Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament
p229_206 It wasn't to be
p229_207 I wanted to put myself on the line
p229_209 I came home by ambulance
p229_210 It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions
p229_211 It's the same old story
p229_212 But we are not immune to the problem
p229_213 He has a lot of experience as captain in his career
p229_214 The sisters also became the top two players in the world
p229_215 The procedures were not in place
p229_216 It was worth a photograph
p229_217 We will give a formal response to the report in due course
p229_218 After that time, the market itself will set the prices
p229_219 Saddam Hussein is a devil
p229_220 That is an important part of our role
p229_221 She should not be blamed
p229_222 We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence
p229_223 I am delighted for Simon
p229_224 I had decided to quit the show
p229_225 The FBI could become involved
p229_226 However, Dundee deserved to win this game
p229_227 For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon
p229_228 On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football
p229_229 The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument
p229_230 Who was on the panel ?
p229_231 We've got the bronze
p229_232 Saturday is gone
p229_233 At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher
p229_234 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p229_235 The boy is no longer with us
p229_236 The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia
p229_237 The track is currently covered in snow
p229_238 I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision
p229_239 You should always be able to get out in some direction
p229_240 We are so proud
p229_241 We were a load of rubbish
p229_242 The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days
p229_243 It's an idea
p229_244 On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence
p229_245 The sanctions are about collective punishment
p229_246 We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there
p229_247 The perception is that we do not care about social issues
p229_248 The problem in Norway is outside the National
p229_249 The letters are going out today
p229_250 It's only fair
p229_251 Chambers said he would accept the place
p229_252 Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries
p229_253 It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak
p229_254 It was a hit
p229_255 A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe
p229_256 This year I understood
p229_257 He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather
p229_258 Kirkwood was arrested
p229_259 This is a big club
p229_260 That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match
p229_261 I was happily surprised
p229_262 They must play for each other
p229_263 The pensioners did not want to know
p229_264 He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention
p229_265 Today we can say that a new era has begun
p229_266 That is highly unfair
p229_267 The warning is timely
p229_268 Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention
p229_269 That decision is for the British Parliament and people
p229_270 They are never here
p229_271 I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset
p229_272 He was also married with two children
p229_273 It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players
p229_274 We're in shock
p229_275 Our objective is to tackle poverty
p229_277 It's a way of life
p229_278 She has fallen in love with Scotland, however
p229_279 He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry
p229_280 I am an estate agent
p229_281 People have no choice
p229_282 They were on holiday in Egypt
p229_283 It was a privilege to work for him
p229_284 In fact, he was talking about the survival business
p229_285 If not, he should go home
p229_286 For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray
p229_287 I saw it at a ruck
p229_288 I felt like I was a child
p229_289 What would be the timetable for withdrawal ?
p229_290 The orchestra is quite good, but the hall is terrible
p229_292 We have other options
p229_293 I do not think this family will ever get over this
p229_294 It shows a contempt by him for the industry
p229_295 These figures are truly awful
p229_296 Sunday's game was not a trial
p229_297 Disruption will be kept to a minimum
p229_298 The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland
p229_300 I was brought up in a mining background
p229_301 I thought it was my only chance
p229_302 Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman
p229_303 The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office
p229_304 The most important thing is to get a programme for government
p229_305 There is no openness
p229_306 This is a war over our home
p229_307 In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge
p229_308 It's just not funny !
p229_309 It is no country for a man or woman of letters
p229_310 The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn
p229_311 You are the glory
p229_312 However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart
p229_313 Let's hope it's an investment in the future
p229_314 It's certainly different
p229_315 O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place
p229_316 This is the culture change in medicine
p229_318 It's about my time as a guitarist
p229_319 There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh
p229_320 It's not even finished
p229_322 It should be equal
p229_323 Cruelty is an accepted feature of conflict in the Balkans
p229_324 We are very strongly behind the bid
p229_325 In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times
p229_326 I am very happy to be here
p229_328 It was no secret that I wanted to sign him
p229_329 On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research
p229_330 It could have gone either way
p229_331 He was then replaced by Ross
p229_332 I'd like to take the plunge
p229_333 She did not attend the courtroom
p229_334 It is difficult to get into the team at the moment
p229_335 He told the court
p229_336 The team for the first game could be this one
p229_337 They haven't got a hope
p229_338 It has moved on in the last week
p229_339 Gaelic provision continued to be good
p229_340 He did a good job
p229_341 I'm so pleased the show has won a prize
p229_342 Today she has been released
p229_343 These days are long gone
p229_344 They might be broken, but they are not defeated
p229_345 But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party
p229_346 Indeed, it was magical
p229_347 I've got no secret
p229_348 Look at the witnesses
p229_349 The visual arts committee took this decision in December
p229_350 I'm very lucky
p229_351 They may yet have the last laugh
p229_352 Everything was an effort
p229_353 This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required
p229_354 Like his acting, it was an accident
p229_355 It is long gone
p229_356 It's the last thing on my mind
p229_357 Tell us about it
p229_358 There is a cup final at stake
p229_359 That is a break with tradition
p229_360 It was very formal
p229_361 They say that vital evidence was not heard in court
p229_362 In addition, it was in breach of natural justice
p229_363 It benefits the whole family
p229_364 It was fit for royalty
p229_365 We are looking for perfection
p229_366 It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives
p229_367 The group is due to publish its report in the autumn
p229_368 I am a star
p229_369 We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors
p229_370 He could make it
p229_371 He later became a respected High Court judge
p229_373 For one veteran, the memories remain vivid
p229_374 It is not too late to get on board
p229_376 It is a simple equation
p229_377 Talks are progressing
p229_378 They play together perfectly
p229_379 It's a long process
p229_380 Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter
p229_381 It does not even have a staff shortage
p229_382 However, the players should have a voice in these matters
p229_384 It is obvious that we are engaged in a war
p229_386 Three years ago he would have been
p229_387 That team is due to be announced this morning
p229_388 It has been a lovely family occasion
p229_389 That's the name of the game, though
p229_390 There were no casualties
p229_391 A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting
p229_392 Yet the data is compelling
p230_001 Please call Stella
p230_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p230_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p230_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p230_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p230_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p230_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p230_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p230_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p230_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p230_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p230_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p230_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky
p230_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p230_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by the reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p230_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p230_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p230_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p230_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p230_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p230_025 It is on the internet
p230_026 Smoking is also very important
p230_027 He has the courage of the unaware
p230_028 Life was like a timetable
p230_029 It shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does
p230_030 Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy
p230_031 I'm so happy that she did
p230_032 The wedding was in Edinburgh
p230_033 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p230_034 He really is a lovely man
p230_035 The staff are as good as any staff in the city
p230_036 This represents a tough game for us
p230_037 The boy is no longer with us
p230_038 They said she was stable
p230_039 This will save interest charges
p230_040 Well, he is an artist
p230_041 He looks like an Afghan
p230_042 People want to see me on the screen
p230_043 The big problem is the lack of grass
p230_044 That was the theory, anyway
p230_045 I was inspired by two things
p230_046 If not, he should go home
p230_047 I must take a seat
p230_048 It was bound to happen
p230_049 We have to bring in new players
p230_050 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p230_051 I have made that offer
p230_052 None has ever been found
p230_053 Four other charges were dropped
p230_054 We should be able to cope
p230_055 There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement
p230_056 We will pay their bills
p230_057 You should consider whether you want to be in this film
p230_058 It was exactly four months away
p230_059 He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture
p230_060 It's not covered by the insurance
p230_061 But the challenge is in the US
p230_062 Robin Williams is very subdued
p230_063 The tournament has now been cancelled
p230_064 They would now be able to look forward with confidence
p230_065 Both sides have been hit by injury
p230_066 He also received a medal of honour
p230_068 It may be that lifestyle is behind it
p230_069 It is a job creation scheme
p230_070 It looks like a hit
p230_071 What do we do ?
p230_072 Why do it otherwise ?
p230_073 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p230_074 However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made
p230_075 After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction
p230_076 Consumer confidence remains an issue
p230_077 Last week, he was taken into hospital
p230_078 This is a true story
p230_079 By then, he was walking on water
p230_080 It's so hard to shift
p230_081 They lived for their children
p230_083 It might change your life
p230_084 You are a great player
p230_085 However, it did not end that way
p230_086 We will deal with the refugees
p230_087 It was not an insult
p230_088 You might not make it
p230_089 However, a decision should be made before the end of August
p230_090 I did not have a bet on myself
p230_091 The conclusion is the same
p230_092 He was prepared for this
p230_093 But I know the course
p230_094 You are like an animal
p230_095 We intend to change the model
p230_096 It was some time before she found out he was safe
p230_097 Two of the team became ill
p230_099 It has been a nightmare of frustration
p230_100 But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant
p230_101 Before the game we went for a pint
p230_102 This was a good move for me
p230_103 It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials
p230_104 I was just appalled at the way they behaved
p230_105 It is close to call
p230_106 It is an impressive record
p230_107 It is a total and utter change of culture
p230_108 He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter
p230_109 Abbey National is an option
p230_110 The arrival of the Scottish Premier League has also presented a problem
p230_112 We have the mental strength
p230_113 You can spend money on housing
p230_114 That admission is not surprising
p230_115 I can't even get into the A team
p230_116 Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership
p230_117 Which can happen any time
p230_118 It is too pretty, it is too small
p230_119 But this time we can have no excuses
p230_120 They are very happy with the new settlement
p230_121 The abuse of elderly people was appalling
p230_122 Something will be done by corporate bodies
p230_123 We did what we had to do
p230_124 She was also very brave
p230_125 On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door
p230_126 We must recognise that this outfit is unique
p230_127 The opposite is the case
p230_128 He was a home referee
p230_129 This is a successful outcome
p230_130 Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray
p230_131 She died at her home
p230_132 Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition
p230_133 Five minutes later, the home team were back in front
p230_134 It was a piece of art
p230_135 I would relish the prospect
p230_137 These men are a part of India
p230_138 I was caught out a little bit
p230_139 The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday
p230_140 I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery
p230_141 It has to be an event
p230_142 It was deployed in the Gulf War
p230_143 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p230_144 The first thing is to assess the damage that has been done
p230_145 She has gone to the Catholic school
p230_146 It was by the numbers
p230_147 I am not going to make any further comment, apart from that
p230_148 This year, this month, will be special for Torrance
p230_149 However, he was later released without charge
p230_150 This might seem like an outrageous assertion
p230_151 These days are long gone
p230_152 I'm afraid to say anything
p230_153 We are still getting over it
p230_154 It has to be now
p230_155 It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened
p230_156 You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues
p230_157 They will do their own thing
p230_158 You had to go and see him
p230_159 So what is the campaign about ?
p230_160 And does it ?
p230_161 Are you from the rugby ?
p230_162 Had I heard ?
p230_163 Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo
p230_164 Our position remains the same
p230_165 Nobody did in those days
p230_166 We believe in the medium term
p230_167 It's nice to be nice
p230_168 To get good people, you need to offer them enough money
p230_169 On the month the weakness was across the board
p230_170 One season, they might do well
p230_171 Manchester United can win the European Cup this season
p230_172 First and foremost, the game is entirely different
p230_173 But he has a lifeline
p230_174 Phase one was a shambles
p230_175 City sentiment is in his favour
p230_176 I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal
p230_177 At the top level, the salaries are far too high
p230_178 Tomorrow is a new day
p230_179 It makes no influence on the public
p230_180 She has left the island
p230_181 He played it like a veteran
p230_182 I have spoken to head office
p230_183 They will run a mile
p230_184 It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area
p230_185 Our destiny is in our own hands
p230_186 He prefers to play for them
p230_188 He lives in a neighbouring village
p230_189 It was an odd affair, in many respects
p230_190 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p230_191 We represent a wide range of society
p230_192 We always felt we could win
p230_194 This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds
p230_195 It is not all good news and relief for Labour, however
p230_196 Neither side would reveal the details of the offer
p230_198 I made a terrible start
p230_199 The result is called a patent
p230_200 We played them off the pitch
p230_201 Racism has no place in any sport
p230_202 Tommy is not a problem
p230_203 The sanctions are about collective punishment
p230_204 This is a holy place
p230_205 He had suffered a heart attack
p230_206 The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office
p230_207 We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead
p230_208 This will take several weeks
p230_209 The research is published in the journal, Nature
p230_210 We have an election in eight days
p230_211 Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match
p230_212 There is no quick fix
p230_213 All will be revealed in due course
p230_214 We used to live with dignity in our country
p230_215 The most exciting room is the final one of the show
p230_216 He has made his base in Spain
p230_217 My life is in the ballet
p230_218 Basically, they have to come up with the offer
p230_219 It's all change at Kilmarnock
p230_220 His second was a beauty
p230_221 What do we want to do that for ?
p230_222 Does the name matter ?
p230_223 How do you get it back ?
p230_224 What are you not good at ?
p230_225 The Prime Minister was informed on Thursday
p230_226 However, Dundee deserved to win this game
p230_227 It was a day for records
p230_228 He remains a main board director of Royal
p230_230 That has been the easy part
p230_231 Things were so intense in the studio
p230_232 I was not sure whether I had won
p230_233 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p230_234 So far, the problems have occurred in the US
p230_235 It is the voice of the survivors
p230_236 It had so much to do with output
p230_237 Must have been at the bar
p230_238 She died in middle age
p230_239 No evidence that it was Osama bin Laden
p230_240 They need to win a trophy
p230_241 Half the young people had had contact with the police
p230_242 It is possible to be too good
p230_243 In many ways, that is as important
p230_244 Here is a question for you
p230_245 I was just a kid
p230_246 Sadly, it sounds as if it is
p230_247 Hospitals are for the ill
p230_248 However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart
p230_249 Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter
p230_250 We have to compete at our own level
p230_251 They showed a lot of heart
p230_252 This gives a financial incentive to switch
p230_253 It might be sad, but it's a fact
p230_254 She took them for a term
p230_255 Kingfisher can afford to wait
p230_257 Nato was not a love affair
p230_258 Defensive stocks attracted some interest
p230_259 Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries
p230_260 In fact, we were all over the shop
p230_261 You can feel at home in China
p230_262 Persuaded to change his mind
p230_263 Either way, the investor retains the premium
p230_264 It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak
p230_265 In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win
p230_266 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p230_267 I should think so, too
p230_268 Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me
p230_269 I've had no discussions with the chairman of the board
p230_270 I was ready for this
p230_271 On the contrary they stand to gain
p230_272 They are interior designers and architects
p230_273 That should be the subject matter of a public debate
p230_274 We feel very good about it
p230_276 It succeeds in a direct and convincing manner
p230_277 It is also very valuable
p230_278 None of this work is guaranteed
p230_279 There is a case to answer
p230_280 We're trying to get rounded performers
p230_281 They can leave at any time
p230_282 And they were being paid ?
p230_283 was everything done to save people ?
p230_284 What was the matter for concern ?
p230_285 Do I think about them often ?
p230_286 That was a gold medal for certain
p230_287 You get a lot for your money
p230_288 Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt
p230_289 In that moment, I was happy
p230_290 The actor has met with Mandela
p230_291 It was never a free kick
p230_292 It is a recipe for success
p230_293 I would rather look at him
p230_295 It's got to come from me
p230_296 It took a month and a half to film
p230_297 The cause of the accident remained unclear
p230_298 It is a symbolic concert
p230_299 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p230_300 Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished
p230_302 He is at war with his knee
p230_303 Again the parallel with football can be drawn
p230_304 I was there five months ago
p230_305 You have to see it like this
p230_306 Rugby is now just like football
p230_307 It could well be military
p230_308 His job was not advertised
p230_309 There is an element of racism in Scotland
p230_310 We have a clean bill of health
p230_311 And we can do it
p230_312 The songs are just so good
p230_313 The casting is as perfect
p230_314 I can hardly believe it
p230_315 I must do something about it
p230_316 Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear
p230_317 If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world
p230_318 They are not left wing
p230_319 McNaughton was not so sure
p230_321 It is a road of death
p230_322 The party lasted all night
p230_323 The group is not paying a dividend
p230_324 We were on our way
p230_325 I was as strong as a horse
p230_326 That meant the search was unlawful
p230_327 We have a good healthy debate
p230_328 I would do away with the dress code
p230_329 We are on a four-year mission
p230_330 This is a historic occasion
p230_331 This ruling is a farce
p230_332 I can see their argument
p230_333 After some discussion they did
p230_334 It was always an option
p230_335 Does that put pressure on us ?
p230_336 Did it work ?
p230_337 Do you think we are a top nation ?
p230_338 Public opinion was split on the proposal
p230_339 The election is total confusion and chaos
p230_340 You may have a short memory
p230_341 Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars
p230_342 In the old days, it was easy
p230_343 There was some merit in that
p230_344 That is a trend which will be encouraged
p230_345 The airport was even different
p230_346 Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons
p230_347 We think all other measures are not exhausted
p230_348 There was no time scale
p230_349 Last night, he pledged to clear his name
p230_350 On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research
p230_351 He is not very big, either
p230_352 I have a moral dilemma
p230_353 Even the one she loved
p230_354 You have no chance of planning permission
p230_355 We are encouraged by the news
p230_356 In addition, certain areas closed at certain times
p230_357 The professor said the results were positive
p230_358 In fact, it is deeply unpleasant
p230_359 Three years ago he would have been
p230_360 Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground
p230_361 The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper
p230_362 I am a lucky man
p230_363 Nobody else was with me
p230_364 We put our bid in last night
p230_365 Alex Ferguson is the same
p230_366 George Mitchell is trying to close the gap
p230_367 But BA said the prediction was premature
p230_368 Like his acting, it was an accident
p230_369 They have broken the promise
p230_370 We are really good friends
p230_371 My goal is quite simple
p230_372 This is a major championship
p230_373 It's going to be fun
p230_374 She is now on the back benches
p230_375 Scrutiny by European Parliament is limited
p230_376 This hasn't happened in a vacuum
p230_377 Both of those promises have already been honoured
p230_378 We are a Scottish company
p230_379 We will win the argument
p230_380 Tomorrow will be a different game entirely
p230_381 It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage
p230_382 I always knew she was funny
p230_383 He is a close friend of Gordon Brown
p230_384 The marshall at the turn was great
p230_385 If you can get it
p230_386 On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options
p230_387 There was a substantial explosion
p230_388 The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account
p230_389 He could face a jail sentence
p230_390 That is the consistent approach of the Government
p230_391 This big issue is whether it can be enforced
p230_392 Clark is back on top form
p230_393 Motion described it as a unique event
p230_394 I had a fortunate war
p230_395 Are they free ?
p230_396 What are they for ?
p230_397 Is there a waiting list ?
p230_398 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p230_399 That investment has now been secured
p230_400 It is a large number
p230_401 You will not feel a thing
p230_402 I've never seen a game like it
p230_404 It does not even have a staff shortage
p230_405 It was a bank holiday, after all
p230_406 We're obviously disturbed by this case
p230_407 The casualties were not named
p230_408 It is a temptation which should be resisted
p230_409 It had been on the cards
p230_410 The second goal was superb
p230_411 Treatment is not an issue with these people
p230_413 Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope
p230_414 It is the old story
p230_415 This should put downward pressure on inflation
p230_416 No date has been set for a meeting
p230_417 We have to build a new team in the minimum of time
p231_001 Please call Stella
p231_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p231_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p231_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p231_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p231_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p231_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p231_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p231_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p231_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p231_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p231_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p231_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p231_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p231_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p231_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from the earth to their home in the sky
p231_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p231_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p231_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p231_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p231_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p231_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p231_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p231_025 On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value
p231_026 I'd just like to play
p231_027 Because we do not need it
p231_028 There was a rush of water
p231_029 Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted
p231_030 That deal is a joke
p231_031 The Premier League has been a huge success
p231_032 If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it
p231_033 It carried a double message
p231_034 That means an extra two years
p231_035 I became a widow overnight
p231_036 But he can turn on the charm
p231_037 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p231_038 The man became a reporter
p231_039 Mr Blair last night attended his weekly audience with the Queen
p231_040 Last year, I was pretty bad
p231_041 Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man
p231_042 Among them are many criminals
p231_043 He looks like an Afghan
p231_044 He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted
p231_045 I guess I was lucky, though
p231_046 I was inspired by two things
p231_047 A win is a win
p231_048 There was no safety net
p231_049 There's nothing we could do about this
p231_050 It is a symbolic concert
p231_051 We keep an eye on it
p231_052 We have not given up hope
p231_053 The cuts were made within an hour of each other
p231_054 She said she was really sorry
p231_055 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p231_056 Italy is a beautiful place
p231_057 Four other charges were dropped
p231_058 We should be able to cope
p231_059 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p231_061 So is that it, then ?
p231_062 Do I have a favourite ?
p231_063 What do we do ?
p231_064 It was a lovely experience
p231_065 The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow
p231_066 We will pay their bills
p231_067 Only water is currently allowed
p231_068 He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture
p231_069 We need to increase the membership
p231_070 This is an exciting new venture
p231_071 He highlighted a lack of staff
p231_072 Then followed a bout of flu
p231_073 Both sides have been hit by injury
p231_074 Both men were on one-year contracts
p231_076 That would be too easy
p231_078 After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction
p231_079 Both agreed on the success of the event
p231_080 Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat
p231_081 On Saturday, it was much the same
p231_082 It's so hard to shift
p231_083 They lived for their children
p231_085 However, it did not end that way
p231_086 Strathclyde Police declined to comment
p231_087 It is an old family habit
p231_088 He's been hit by it
p231_089 However, a decision should be made before the end of August
p231_090 I saw the whole thing
p231_091 But I know the course
p231_092 Their attitude is all wrong
p231_093 We must stop it with the golf ball
p231_094 You are like an animal
p231_095 This is the logic of punishment assaults
p231_097 We should recognise others have done a good job
p231_098 We live by the rule of law
p231_099 Two of the team became ill
p231_100 No, the equipment is extra
p231_101 That time is not now, however
p231_102 It's not a quick fix
p231_103 Why do it otherwise ?
p231_104 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p231_105 So, did she meet him ?
p231_106 So what is the campaign about ?
p231_107 And does it ?
p231_108 Before the game we went for a pint
p231_109 We needed financial backing to get it off the ground
p231_110 You'd better believe it
p231_111 New Year will be very busy
p231_112 There's still plenty time left
p231_113 It proved a good decision
p231_114 Maybe this battle has been
p231_115 January is a bad time of year
p231_116 I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar
p231_117 It is much as it has been described
p231_118 Then again, we could have
p231_119 It is a delight on every level
p231_120 There were no grounds for his action
p231_121 I was just a child
p231_122 We should not be surprised
p231_123 It was not a finale he would want to remember
p231_124 Despite the result, it was still a great moment
p231_125 That period was a struggle
p231_126 It is too pretty, it is too small
p231_127 This should begin in October
p231_128 That is far too high
p231_129 If not, a deal could take many months
p231_130 It plans to return to this field
p231_131 They made such decisions in London
p231_132 Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll
p231_133 It is a common problem
p231_134 You're a gambling man
p231_135 We must recognise that this outfit is unique
p231_136 He is a great addition to our team
p231_137 This is a successful outcome
p231_138 In this case, the farmer had actually given permission
p231_139 Put yourself in the position of being a referee
p231_140 I think he's the favourite, no question
p231_141 I miss the freedom that I had
p231_142 It only increased the support for him
p231_143 Anyone can do the sums
p231_144 Five minutes later, the home team were back in front
p231_145 It opens the door to the Champions League
p231_146 It has become a way of life
p231_147 The whole industry is a shambles
p231_148 There's only one team in Ayrshire
p231_149 It was deployed in the Gulf War
p231_150 We have a clean bill of health
p231_151 It is not normal practice
p231_152 The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms
p231_153 He was asked to quit
p231_154 A new school will be built
p231_155 The strong pound also took its toll
p231_156 It is a terrible tragedy
p231_157 He was right into football from an early age
p231_158 It is not like us
p231_159 What happened in that game ?
p231_160 Are you going to win ?
p231_161 Was it the wife ?
p231_162 Why change it ?
p231_163 What do we want to do that for ?
p231_164 He was in great spirits
p231_165 We have a budget in March
p231_166 You've been a great audience
p231_167 It is simply not true
p231_168 Well, this article is a bit like that
p231_169 It is really good news
p231_170 We've made a couple of albums
p231_171 To get good people, you need to offer them enough money
p231_172 My life has been destroyed
p231_173 I always felt they played for me
p231_174 One season, they might do well
p231_175 First and foremost, the game is entirely different
p231_176 This much I can tell you
p231_177 The Hibs manager is no fool
p231_178 We are the gateway to justice
p231_179 But one was not enough
p231_180 I have spoken to head office
p231_181 I am not ready to walk away
p231_183 The shooting created panic in the street
p231_184 So many people will be affected by this
p231_185 As many as the market will support
p231_186 They need to look after themselves
p231_188 This is the time to use it
p231_189 You know the sort of thing
p231_190 I'm interested in interesting work
p231_191 We represent a wide range of society
p231_192 People will ask about us
p231_193 Neither side would reveal the details of the offer
p231_194 This should put downward pressure on inflation
p231_195 On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door
p231_196 I came home by ambulance
p231_197 I suggest a new plan
p231_198 It was a moment of madness
p231_199 Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon
p231_200 Libya is an easy target
p231_201 Does the name matter ?
p231_202 how do you get it back ?
p231_203 What are you no good at ?
p231_205 Who was she ?
p231_206 It gave no further details
p231_207 You've caught a serial killer
p231_208 I won't make an official complaint
p231_209 We are a new department
p231_210 It was worth a photograph
p231_211 They are looking at flotation
p231_212 Which isn't a bad idea
p231_213 We have an election in eight days
p231_214 He also presented You Bet!
p231_215 That might help a bit
p231_216 I had decided to quit the show
p231_217 He has a lot of skill
p231_218 I've wanted to buy one for the National Gallery
p231_219 However, Dundee deserved to win this game
p231_220 And the World Cup has not even begun
p231_221 The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo
p231_222 That you can do it
p231_223 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p231_224 They all made the European Ryder Cup team
p231_225 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p231_226 This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely
p231_228 We played them off the pitch
p231_229 So far, the problems have occurred in the US
p231_230 They are the innocent victims
p231_231 Paterson can afford to be generous
p231_232 She died in middle age
p231_233 I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight
p231_234 It is set in Paris
p231_235 The irony was not lost
p231_236 Sadly, it sounds as if it is
p231_237 Hospitals are for the ill
p231_238 The minister is the engineer
p231_239 My future is in the marathon
p231_240 It is now the big brother
p231_241 The parties have no contact
p231_242 She took them for a term
p231_243 Nato was not a love affair
p231_244 He is due in Israel tomorrow
p231_245 You can feel at home in China
p231_246 His is a global perspective
p231_247 Persuaded to change his mind
p231_248 Either way, the investor retains the premium
p231_249 This ruling is a farce
p231_250 The baby deserves the credit
p231_251 Washington is consumed by the crisis
p231_252 But they were never expected to last
p231_253 It was a cry for help
p231_254 No production contract is yet in sight
p231_255 Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland
p231_256 A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe
p231_257 He admitted that he knew nothing about it
p231_258 It seems a shame to leave it
p231_259 It was the climax of the thing
p231_260 The concerns are the same
p231_261 I can't get a job
p231_262 And they were being paid ?
p231_263 was everything done to save people ?
p231_264 What was the matter for concern ?
p231_265 Do I think about them often ?
p231_266 Is it in the right place ?
p231_267 Did he trip ?
p231_268 I've had the time of my life
p231_269 The property is owned by Glasgow City Council
p231_270 On the contrary they stand to gain
p231_271 I thought he might have been a bit
p231_272 This news came after the stock market closed on Monday
p231_273 I'd never run for them
p231_274 It is a mark of respect from the inmates
p231_275 It does not work that way in Scottish football
p231_276 These figures are truly terrible
p231_277 Share prices have fallen for three years in a row
p231_278 The joint bid is still on course
p231_279 At first I thought I was gone
p231_280 The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack
p231_281 They can leave at any time
p231_282 That view has not altered
p231_283 You get a lot for your money
p231_284 Blair also had a penalty
p231_285 It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight
p231_286 Frankly, we should all have such problems
p231_288 The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline
p231_289 She has fallen in love with Scotland, however
p231_290 They were on holiday in Egypt
p231_291 It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday
p231_292 I've lost all confidence
p231_293 This could be a mistake
p231_294 Once again, they would be wrong
p231_295 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p231_296 It's all designed to speed up the service
p231_297 He will address the nation this evening
p231_298 They have shown a great desire and attitude
p231_299 I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh
p231_300 But it is up again
p231_301 Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled
p231_302 It could well be military
p231_303 I was just so determined
p231_304 That was the difference between the sides
p231_305 The judge was really nice
p231_307 You are a different people
p231_308 Disruption will be kept to a minimum
p231_309 He is still in shock
p231_310 McNaughton was not so sure
p231_312 I thought it was my only chance
p231_313 I thought he did very well
p231_314 I'm not making any comment at all
p231_315 Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter
p231_316 We're on our way
p231_317 They come to enjoy themselves
p231_318 That meant the search was unlawful
p231_319 They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house
p231_320 However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart
p231_322 We want to play at the worlds
p231_323 However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals
p231_324 We have got no money to go anywhere
p231_325 Have a look at this lot
p231_326 That decision will be made over the next couple of days
p231_327 The king is delighted by the honour
p231_328 It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register
p231_329 The problems began a long time ago
p231_330 I am not sure about the rate of progress
p231_331 To beat the European champion is quite nice
p231_332 In the old days, it was easy
p231_333 However, the groups denied the claims
p231_334 She is now on the back benches
p231_336 I think it's about time
p231_337 The airport was even different
p231_338 There was no time scale
p231_339 In his absence, the council adopted the change
p231_340 At first, the youngster was not keen
p231_341 The figures are bad, but not that bad
p231_342 Last night, he pledged to clear his name
p231_343 Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items
p231_344 He was then replaced by Ross
p231_345 Finally came the moment of truth
p231_346 We are encouraged by the news
p231_347 What form did that take ?
p231_348 Are they free ?
p231_349 What are they for ?
p231_350 Is there a waiting list ?
p231_351 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p231_352 So what happens next ?
p231_353 The units will not be replaced
p231_354 Neither man has been charged
p231_355 Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side
p231_357 Look at the Liberal Democrats
p231_358 I am a lucky man
p231_359 But they have taken the lesson to heart
p231_360 I've always been a sensitive
p231_361 Glasgow is a friendly city
p231_362 You did not see it
p231_363 We live on an island
p231_364 It is not real life
p231_365 Neither woman has been named
p231_366 They should take their mobile phones
p231_367 You need a licence to run a pub
p231_368 We regret that they're brought in the first place
p231_369 Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months
p231_370 This is a major championship
p231_371 The result is called a patent
p231_372 But we finished the show
p231_373 They were to blame for the first two goals
p231_374 There is no deal as yet
p231_375 Here is a weather forecast for the weekend
p231_376 We were given a break
p231_377 In due course the deal was done
p231_378 to have products for their needs
p231_379 The pair are very much in love
p231_380 We will win the argument
p231_381 Had this been common practice ?
p231_382 What do they want us to do ?
p231_383 Is it worth it ?
p231_384 Does it matter ?
p231_385 You have to rely on each other
p231_386 The Internet is no substitute for customer service
p231_387 I wanted to go out on a high
p231_388 Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors
p231_389 That time may never be broken
p231_390 It was fit for royalty
p231_391 The response from them was good
p231_392 There was a substantial explosion
p231_393 But we are very near
p231_394 That's as good as it gets
p231_395 A review is under way
p231_396 He put some colour into Scottish history
p231_397 This big issue is whether it can be enforced
p231_398 They have failed to deliver
p231_399 Clark is back on top form
p231_400 I had a fortunate war
p231_401 She is in their hands
p231_402 It is a large number
p231_403 It does not even have a staff shortage
p231_404 It is hard to understand
p231_405 It was a bank holiday, after all
p231_406 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p231_407 There was an element of frustration
p231_408 I should think so, too
p231_409 How do you take them away ?
p231_411 After the match, do you ?
p231_412 I will always remember the horrible images
p231_414 They are looking for profit
p231_415 I remain a buyer of the shares
p231_416 There is some light in the tunnel
p231_417 He liked the weather, the courses, the food
p231_418 There will be widespread support on all sides
p231_419 The case will now go to appeal
p231_420 Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope
p231_421 There is a solution, she believes
p231_422 Yet the data is compelling
p231_423 It was important to win the singles
p231_424 The road was closed for several hours
p231_426 My aim is a top six finish
p231_427 I would love to think that she could win
p231_428 Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime
p231_429 He is on the wrong side
p231_430 It was a breathtaking moment
p231_431 I was in jail for five years
p231_432 I never had a childhood
p231_433 It is based on a true story
p231_434 But it can be done
p231_435 I never won a penny throughout my career
p231_436 There will be no excuses on Wednesday
p231_437 The growth potential is enormous
p231_438 They are not left wing
p231_439 The British government does not want to know
p231_440 They said they were only young men
p231_441 We shall not forget him
p231_442 The people are the hero
p231_443 They made a huge impression on me
p231_444 It's never easy to win an Olympic gold medal
p231_445 It sounded like a bomb
p231_446 Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey
p231_447 We've got a good management record
p231_448 Sentiment was helped by the sharp fall in debt
p231_449 And we might go back
p231_450 We have just got to keep his feet on the ground
p231_451 We went straight into the bedroom
p231_452 Its future is no longer in question
p231_453 We put our bid in last night
p231_454 Today, he is in the same position as four years ago
p231_456 They have to be met
p231_457 We think a lot of Allan McGregor
p231_458 She has reached the top of her profession
p231_459 But he has a lifeline
p231_460 A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing
p231_461 They were good years for him
p231_462 Let that be their memorial
p231_463 Nine days later, he suffered another attack
p231_464 Driving has been the key
p231_465 She has now been registered as disabled
p231_466 He is well respected by his colleagues
p231_467 Classes must be reduced by half
p231_468 War is not the action
p231_469 However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action
p231_470 It is too early to speculate
p231_471 Dennis was not so sure
p231_472 He felt it was the right time
p231_473 It was clear on Thursday
p231_474 The casting of her husband was an accident
p231_475 It was all in a short period of time
p231_476 That was the first time I worked with Richard
p232_001 Please call Stella
p232_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p232_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p232_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p232_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p232_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p232_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p232_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p232_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p232_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p232_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p232_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p232_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p232_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p232_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p232_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p232_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p232_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p232_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p232_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p232_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p232_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p232_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p232_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p232_025 Johnson was pretty low
p232_026 But it failed
p232_027 Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format
p232_028 They should be so lucky
p232_029 Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected
p232_030 They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday
p232_031 It's a matter of balance
p232_032 They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide
p232_033 I would love it
p232_034 It is marvellous
p232_035 Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night
p232_036 But it may take some time to confirm the findings
p232_037 Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack
p232_038 It was fit for royalty
p232_039 I was scared
p232_040 Dancing was her life
p232_041 I suspect the latter
p232_042 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p232_043 But it took a lot of bottle
p232_044 We will push
p232_045 It is urgent
p232_046 The judge said
p232_047 It is difficult for Ali
p232_048 But it might have done
p232_049 The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids
p232_050 They had to explain it
p232_051 Here's a clue
p232_052 We were surprised to see the photograph
p232_053 It's the big omission
p232_054 Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident
p232_055 It's very odd
p232_056 Because we do not need it
p232_057 It's not pretty, but it's effective
p232_058 This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers
p232_059 That's the truth
p232_060 That is very hard, alone
p232_061 The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine
p232_062 The problems are a result of that shortfall
p232_063 You do not change overnight
p232_064 People love to see this stuff
p232_065 He was popular
p232_066 I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset
p232_067 Charles Kennedy had an effective outing
p232_068 It is like a river running by my home
p232_069 We welcome the decision of Mr Byers
p232_070 There is an element of racism in Scotland
p232_071 Painful, but only because it's true
p232_072 That was the easy election
p232_073 There could be a way back
p232_074 Then followed a bout of flu
p232_075 The price cuts are really exciting
p232_076 I had my suspicions
p232_077 It was chaotic
p232_078 It is a job creation scheme
p232_079 He is now resident in England
p232_080 I've got the shirt
p232_081 Today she has been released
p232_082 What has changed ?
p232_083 That is bound to happen
p232_084 I will miss him
p232_085 It's all going to clear the debt
p232_086 She had kept the news from him
p232_087 No progress has been made
p232_088 Others were in hiding, in fear of their lives
p232_089 Now the system is right behind us
p232_090 Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today
p232_091 It is a lifeline
p232_092 Today I couldn't run on it
p232_093 However, it did not end that way
p232_094 This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit
p232_095 I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party
p232_096 Then came the crunch
p232_097 The oil companies would be asked to contribute
p232_098 I wish I had put on a brighter tie
p232_099 They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs
p232_100 It was mayhem
p232_101 They were outside the circle
p232_102 It was a good performance
p232_103 We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors
p232_104 There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee
p232_105 That is no use
p232_106 It was really enjoyable on Saturday
p232_107 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p232_108 He pleaded for caution
p232_109 He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald
p232_110 I don't have many friends
p232_111 He was jailed for a year
p232_112 You had better believe it
p232_113 It's not fair
p232_114 We have to look at everything before we make any final decision
p232_115 Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee
p232_116 Maybe this battle has been
p232_117 Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants
p232_118 Thereafter, he set his mind on becoming a doctor
p232_119 This is the end of a chapter, and this is very sad
p232_120 It is rubbish
p232_121 That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships
p232_122 The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment
p232_123 An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks
p232_124 That's all right then
p232_125 I'm so angry
p232_126 Child abuse is a dreadful thing
p232_127 It has removed a bit of guilt
p232_128 Despite the result, it was still a great moment
p232_129 The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies
p232_130 Offered the gold medal, he declined
p232_131 That first victory made a huge difference to my career
p232_132 I am now unemployed
p232_133 If not, a deal could take many months
p232_134 You've got to be vigilant
p232_135 Our intentions are real
p232_136 They took a risk
p232_137 The goals were good
p232_138 What will happen then ?
p232_139 I am totally devoted to this job
p232_140 He is severe
p232_141 She died at her home
p232_142 I do not want to have a fight with Mr Hastings
p232_143 They did very well
p232_144 The home side didn't stand a chance
p232_145 We want to see the maximum of change
p232_146 It was deployed in the Gulf War
p232_147 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p232_148 The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday
p232_149 We also enjoyed a lot of support
p232_150 She had gone to the Catholic school
p232_151 It's a problem but it cannot become an excuse
p232_152 It was by the numbers
p232_153 I was in daily contact
p232_154 They were later discharged from hospital
p232_155 This latter point is hugely important
p232_156 It is an attitude of mind
p232_158 They say that vital evidence was not heard in court
p232_159 We have to move forward
p232_160 Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors
p232_161 We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors
p232_162 Tell it like it was ?
p232_163 It is not too late to get on board
p232_164 That must be left to the Parole Board
p232_165 Again, we were lucky
p232_166 Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final
p232_167 Waiting times for these services are too long
p232_168 That will do for me
p232_169 It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate
p232_170 We've made a couple of albums
p232_171 My life has been destroyed
p232_172 They thought they had found a home
p232_173 It became a book by itself
p232_174 I always felt they played for me
p232_175 You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions
p232_176 First and foremost, the game is entirely different
p232_177 Blair's response was weak
p232_178 It's the real thing, for sure
p232_179 However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service
p232_180 The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton
p232_181 The clarity is vital
p232_182 I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal
p232_183 Everyone can be bought
p232_184 A career as a doctor is on hold
p232_185 Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked
p232_186 It is the whole package
p232_187 I've been there
p232_188 Family liaison officers are now working to support the family
p232_189 They receive a high profile in the media
p232_190 We did everything by the book
p232_191 I wish I could say something
p232_192 Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval
p232_193 The procedure is the same in all cases
p232_194 But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections
p232_195 I wanted to put myself on the line
p232_196 I came home by ambulance
p232_197 The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address
p232_198 The conference is the first test
p232_199 The service from the other players was super
p232_200 He's not written as a terribly exciting person in the book
p232_201 On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult
p232_202 The sisters also became the top two players in the world
p232_203 A deadline is still essential
p232_204 We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead
p232_205 It's a mixture of everything
p232_206 We're not seeing an image of the person, he said
p232_207 I don't want to use it
p232_208 Now, it's all right
p232_209 There was an e-mail
p232_210 That's the day job
p232_211 Feel the heat ?
p232_212 He knows a lot
p232_213 He is slightly confused
p232_214 She should not be blamed
p232_215 His third goal was superb
p232_216 He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland
p232_217 It's not ideal
p232_218 He seemed to lose his focus
p232_219 He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda
p232_220 The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument
p232_221 Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement
p232_223 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p232_224 That has been the easy part
p232_225 We've got the bronze
p232_226 Mental health is a massive issue
p232_227 At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher
p232_228 It was good fun
p232_229 What was the main difference ?
p232_230 I am immensely sad
p232_231 I'd never seen a play about me
p232_232 It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come
p232_233 The track is currently covered in snow
p232_234 But she was
p232_235 Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable
p232_236 We were awful
p232_237 However, no further action was taken by police
p232_238 And thought we would get away with it
p232_239 It is set in Paris
p232_240 The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days
p232_241 It's quite nice
p232_242 It's quite a line-up!
p232_243 It's a lovely, lovely film
p232_244 The Home Office would not release any further details about the group
p232_245 Broke the birdie record
p232_246 He claimed the government had lost the plot
p232_247 She is well balanced
p232_248 A change in that position would require a decision by the council
p232_249 Jock Brown is appointed as general manager
p232_250 He says that he is no different from any other man
p232_251 Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries
p232_252 We did not compete with any other local farmer
p232_253 I was certainly wrong with my prediction of the result
p232_254 Some families have even requested to leave the city
p232_255 It's a record label, not a form of music
p232_256 A friendship that will endure
p232_257 I can't get a job
p232_258 He said he intended to push for a judicial review
p232_259 For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique
p232_260 The bottom line is that we had to get a win
p232_261 One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning
p232_262 It does not appear at this stage that alcohol was a factor
p232_263 However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint
p232_264 The work between the musicians and the fire is very important
p232_265 Blood samples were taken
p232_266 They want to shut the Scottish Office
p232_267 That review will look at management across the sector as a whole
p232_268 Of course, that is not the whole story
p232_269 The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision
p232_270 Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races
p232_271 Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate
p232_272 He is a young man with a new deal
p232_273 He was also married with two children
p232_274 Similar measures are expected in England and Wales
p232_275 Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes
p232_276 Everything will fall into place, it should be fine
p232_277 She has every confidence in his performance of his duties
p232_278 They wanted the club to make money
p232_279 Finally, he paid for the movie
p232_280 Sadly, the revival could not be sustained
p232_281 It's a way of life
p232_282 The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline
p232_283 I am an estate agent
p232_284 The record companies have gone through the floor
p232_285 They were on holiday in Egypt
p232_286 It was a privilege to work for him
p232_287 It happens from time to time
p232_288 He looked very sharp
p232_289 Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that
p232_290 I saw it at a ruck
p232_291 They were also beside themselves
p232_292 The attacker died in the crash
p232_293 The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies
p232_294 A tribunal would then consider the seriousness of the incident
p232_295 Police were on the scene within minutes, but the killer had fled
p232_296 He was obviously very genuine
p232_297 These figures are truly awful
p232_298 He should have won
p232_299 He has retired
p232_300 What has altered ?
p232_301 I thought it was my only chance
p232_302 Nothing is safe
p232_303 He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters
p232_305 They are wrong
p232_306 It is a road of death
p232_307 The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand
p232_308 We are in the end game
p232_309 We are now looking at the degrees of injury
p232_310 He was solid
p232_311 Special measures were needed
p232_312 There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh
p232_313 I never thought it would take this long
p232_314 We are a peaceful people
p232_315 Kids are terrible
p232_316 It should be equal
p232_317 Craig is a major concern for us
p232_318 The home team had an amazing start
p232_319 For the moment, our position remains the same
p232_320 Referees are easy targets
p232_321 Davis is very supportive, as a director
p232_322 However, the groups denied the claims
p232_323 I came into this world with nothing
p232_324 We think all other measures are not exhausted
p232_325 Off with their heads
p232_326 It's not long enough
p232_327 My view has now completely changed
p232_328 They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden
p232_329 We agreed to disagree
p232_330 It could have gone either way
p232_331 He was then replaced by Ross
p232_332 Horses are drawn by ballot
p232_333 I'd like to take the plunge
p232_334 Later in the day he was forced to explain his position
p232_335 She did not attend the courtroom
p232_336 It is difficult to get into the team at the moment
p232_337 His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday
p232_338 The team for the first game could be this one
p232_339 They haven't got a hope
p232_340 Who will do it ?
p232_341 Gaelic provision continued to be good
p232_342 That's not eviction because he is not a tenant
p232_343 He also insisted that no concessions had been made to the French
p232_344 He has to learn
p232_345 Indeed, it was magical
p232_346 Tiger is the exception
p232_347 Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector
p232_348 That is the very reason why it was so vital
p232_349 I could hardly move for the next couple of days
p232_350 Chambers said he would accept the place
p232_351 Everything was an effort
p232_352 The boat was fantastic
p232_353 Like his acting, it was an accident
p232_354 It is long gone
p232_355 On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos
p232_356 That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog
p232_357 He had played well in that central role
p232_358 It's not that clear-cut
p232_359 She is free
p232_360 It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened
p232_361 I kept going for her
p232_362 You must have a government and a good civil service
p232_363 But the real problem is the closure of the export market
p232_364 It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage
p232_365 However, it was well worth the wait
p232_366 It benefits the whole family
p232_367 He has seen the past
p232_368 It was one in the afternoon
p232_369 To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential
p232_370 We will be homeless
p232_371 The scene is about this ?
p232_372 Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported
p232_373 Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment
p232_374 The group is due to publish its report in the autumn
p232_375 It was a double tragedy for the family
p232_376 He could make it
p232_377 For one veteran, the memories remain vivid
p232_378 The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland
p232_379 They have not done so this season so far
p232_380 I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself
p232_381 Well, the big day has arrived
p232_382 Five members were disciplined
p232_383 Talks are progressing
p232_384 There is no signature
p232_385 I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role
p232_386 That left a bad taste in my mouth
p232_387 It was as if it was all happening at a garden party
p232_388 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p232_389 It has moved on in the last week
p232_390 That's the name of the game, though
p232_391 You thought it was a headache
p232_392 Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare
p232_393 A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting
p232_394 The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia
p232_395 We're looking for justice
p232_396 I can lead by example
p232_397 I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title
p232_398 But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat
p232_399 Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime
p232_400 It will probably take me just days to spend it
p232_401 It is legally binding
p232_402 We knew nothing about it
p232_403 My house was shaking at the time
p232_404 This is a huge confidence boost
p232_405 We have not yet received a letter from the Irish
p232_406 He was a crazy man
p232_407 We should have known
p232_408 Feel the air, the space
p232_409 Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling
p232_410 I was in a position to challenge for this event and didn't
p232_411 You wanted the evidence
p232_412 Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra
p232_413 It was that bad, that low
p232_414 I was very young
p232_415 We have just got to keep his feet on the ground
p233_001 Please call Stella
p233_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p233_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p233_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p233_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p233_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p233_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p233_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p233_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p233_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p233_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p233_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p233_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p233_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p233_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p233_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p233_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p233_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p233_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p233_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p233_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p233_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p233_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p233_025 We are a service industry
p233_026 But we will have to wait
p233_027 Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports
p233_028 I am not interested in the money, it is the principle
p233_029 However, the following year the cancer returned
p233_030 On our numbers, the price is in line with the asset value
p233_032 Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted
p233_033 This is a central issue
p233_037 However, they continued in their pursuit of victory
p233_038 Victory was never in doubt
p233_039 Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack
p233_040 We are the party of the future
p233_041 I have never been a member of the council
p233_042 He was in his element
p233_043 That means an extra two years
p233_044 At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries
p233_045 All businesses continue to trade
p233_046 The man became a reporter
p233_047 It depends on the decisions of the member states
p233_048 It is all starting to come together
p233_049 Part of the complex is historic
p233_050 The strategy is not without risk
p233_051 But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded
p233_052 I was released after six days
p233_053 Yesterday, he was busy in his office
p233_054 We are working on it
p233_055 I've never been one for complaining about the press
p233_056 This trend is likely to strengthen
p233_057 Still, he did not let himself down this week
p233_058 For the meantime, though, the signs are good
p233_059 There was no safety net
p233_060 He looks as if he could be worth the risk
p233_061 You have to be patient
p233_062 That is all in the past
p233_063 That could be a mistake
p233_064 It was an amazing result
p233_065 Indeed, it is only the beginning
p233_066 He has not been dropped
p233_067 Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London
p233_068 Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued
p233_070 This time, it might be for real
p233_071 She did that for the rest of her life
p233_072 Seriously, we are not concerned at all
p233_073 It starts with the script
p233_074 We were under a bit of pressure
p233_075 The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister
p233_076 We can all make a mistake
p233_077 Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom
p233_079 However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made
p233_080 On the night, it was not enough
p233_081 It is not long term, but I need time to recover
p233_082 However, a ruling will not come before next week
p233_083 They were badly prepared for it
p233_084 It is not a story
p233_085 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p233_086 How are you, sir ?
p233_087 So is that it, then ?
p233_088 Do I have a favourite ?
p233_089 What do we do ?
p233_090 Why do it otherwise ?
p233_091 However, we will obviously keep the matter under review
p233_092 They have a further report to make in March
p233_093 He is in the US
p233_094 The Festival is prepared to help
p233_095 By then, he was walking on water
p233_096 I had a bit in hand
p233_097 We have to have a full statement to Parliament
p233_098 I cannot wait to get started on it
p233_099 That is the fact of the matter
p233_100 It should be a condition of employment
p233_101 I had no intention of misleading anyone
p233_102 It is much as it has been described
p233_103 Police said the family was helping with the search
p233_104 She was there for the start of the campaign
p233_105 He has become a monster
p233_106 In fact, he should never have been in the field
p233_107 Everyone had to play the game
p233_108 In London today, it was business as usual
p233_109 It is not affected by the sale
p233_110 We are currently working on the details
p233_111 According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland
p233_112 I thought it was a fantastic game
p233_113 The picture is the same across Scotland
p233_114 It was the eighties
p233_115 We do not expect any surplus
p233_116 You had better believe it
p233_117 Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw
p233_118 It's not a new concept in jazz
p233_119 My office is bare
p233_120 I'm delighted about that
p233_121 I joined a group
p233_122 They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday
p233_123 Who would be a referee?
p233_125 That's all right then
p233_126 There were no grounds for his action
p233_127 It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside
p233_128 It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged
p233_129 His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years
p233_130 Next season for every manager is a long time away
p233_131 It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation
p233_132 He's been the key to everything
p233_133 It's an amazing landscape!
p233_134 Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family
p233_135 Tenants will be unable to defend themselves
p233_136 The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council
p233_137 I am now unemployed
p233_138 Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland
p233_139 Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll
p233_140 Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general
p233_141 Mr Hall is believed to have broken a leg
p233_142 It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions
p233_143 Is that it ?
p233_144 I saw some terrible things
p233_146 It seems so long since I did the exams
p233_147 We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football
p233_148 Who would be right ?
p233_149 She died at her home
p233_150 He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative
p233_151 That could mean the difference between life and death in action
p233_152 It is like a football team
p233_153 It would be a last resort
p233_154 Initial reports said the aircraft had experienced a loss of power
p233_155 He will emerge as a world leader
p233_156 It opens the door to the Champions League
p233_157 The home side didn't stand a chance

p233_175 Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board
p233_176 Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final
p233_177 The release attracted little attention
p233_178 Waiting times for these services are too long
p233_179 And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers
p233_180 We've made a couple of albums
p233_181 They thought they had found a home
p233_182 He will feel the pain again

p233_188 There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging
p233_189 We are very concerned about controller fatigue
p233_190 I was totally wrong
p233_191 There is no point in looking any further
p233_192 I've been there
p233_193 It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area
p233_194 It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait
p233_195 It's a joke
p233_196 I had a train to catch
p233_197 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p233_198 We are talking about a case of champagne and a vacuum cleaner
p233_199 However, this idea is never developed
p233_200 It's very difficult to find a buyer
p233_201 He may need it
p233_203 It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work
p233_204 It wasn't to be
p233_208 It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council
p233_209 I have a cold
p233_210 He had suffered a heart attack
p233_211 A deadline is still essential
p233_212 I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling

p233_214 That will be vital
p233_215 We need to handle it
p233_216 The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn

p233_230 We played them off the pitch
p233_231 The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions
p233_232 Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval
p233_233 It's a question of creating a future awareness
p233_234 My neighbours are horrified

p233_246 We did not compete with any other local farmer
p233_247 The salary changes are long overdue
p233_248 The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery
p233_249 It is a policy which has the full support of the minister
p233_250 There wasn't a goal
p233_251 It was a cry for help
p233_252 A friendship that will endure
p233_253 This year I understood
p233_254 Her presence was almost everywhere
p233_255 For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique

p233_257 I watched a game
p233_258 There will be tough opponents to this report
p233_259 One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning
p233_260 I was happily surprised

p233_262 It is also very valuable
p233_263 I've spent a lot of time on buses
p233_264 This court has made an order which has not been observed
p233_265 It is not just about pay
p233_266 Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention
p233_267 George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks
p233_268 Blood samples were taken
p233_269 They are never here
p233_270 That review will look at management across the sector as a whole
p233_271 It looks as though he will be right
p233_272 We showed a lot of skill in the final quarter
p233_273 Immediate action must be taken
p233_274 He is a young man with a new deal
p233_275 It was an easy decision to come here
p233_276 It is the same in Sweden
p233_277 And Michael was just great
p233_278 It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players
p233_279 Everything will fall into place, it should be fine
p233_280 She has every confidence in his performance of his duties
p233_281 Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry

p233_285 It was a privilege to work for him

p233_288 They were too hard
p233_289 He looked very sharp
p233_290 All options are open
p233_291 The attacker died in the crash
p233_292 It was a virus
p233_294 I do not think this family will ever get over this
p233_295 Like his acting, it was an accident
p233_296 Sunday's game was not a trial
p233_297 Who can predict ?
p233_298 This is a huge confidence boost
p233_299 I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission
p233_300 We have to sort it out ourselves
p233_301 That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients
p233_302 I thought it was my only chance
p233_303 One was a lawyer
p233_304 Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday

p233_311 Is there on his hands ?
p233_312 We have got no money to go anywhere
p233_313 The election is total confusion and chaos
p233_314 It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register
p233_315 The problems began a long time ago
p233_316 My body is clearly capable
p233_317 We are very strongly behind the bid
p233_319 But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament
p233_320 My view has now completely changed
p233_321 It shows a great deal to come back under that mental pressure
p233_322 We agreed to disagree

p233_324 I saw some good things
p233_325 Later in the day he was forced to explain his position
p233_326 Robert is a special talent
p233_327 It added to the spectacle
p233_328 Who was the mystery MP ?
p233_329 He told the court
p233_330 The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk
p233_331 Who will do it ?
p233_332 However, Sharon rejected the claims

p233_344 His contract was then not renewed
p233_345 Eight months later, he was dead
p233_346 On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos
p233_347 He had played well in that central role
p233_348 The decision is an absolute disgrace
p233_349 Tyson is overwhelmed
p233_350 However, it was well worth the wait
p233_351 He agreed with my proposal
p233_352 Hartley should know
p233_353 Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment
p233_354 The group is due to publish its report in the autumn
p233_355 It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak
p233_356 Also, it is the season of goodwill
p233_357 Equity declined to comment
p233_358 You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel
p233_359 He could make it
p233_360 The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season
p233_361 They have not done so this season so far
p233_362 This big issue is whether it can be enforced
p233_363 Safety was also an issue
p233_364 They received a reply from their own managers
p233_365 But I managed
p233_366 They play together perfectly
p233_367 In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win
p233_368 Colour was at the core of his life
p233_369 It was as if it was all happening at a garden party
p233_370 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p233_371 We shall not be moved
p233_373 It was a hit
p233_374 He's a nice guy
p233_375 Treatment is not an issue with these people
p233_376 Since then, he has played no active part in the company
p233_377 Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director
p233_378 The mood was defiant
p233_379 Yet the data is compelling
p233_381 It's just outrageous
p233_382 The road was closed for several hours
p233_383 It is unusual
p233_384 That will come after the game on Saturday
p233_385 The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position
p233_386 That set the tone
p233_387 It was a breathtaking moment
p233_388 I was in jail for five years
p233_389 What happened in the summer ?
p233_390 The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today
