p273_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p273_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p273_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p273_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p273_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p273_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p273_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, and its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p273_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p273_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p273_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p273_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p273_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p273_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p273_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p273_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p273_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p273_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p273_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p273_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p273_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p273_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p273_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p273_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p273_025 A shortlist is to be drawn up next month
p273_026 It was as if I had been stabbed
p273_027 Because we do not need it
p273_028 It is about control of our economy
p273_029 Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy
p273_030 It is a tough game but we have a chance
p273_031 I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah
p273_032 It carries a double message
p273_033 That is the face of fear
p273_034 The staff are as good as any staff in the city
p273_035 Among them are many criminals
p273_036 This will save interest charges
p273_037 Every aspect of our play was first class
p273_038 He looks like an Afghan
p273_039 Everything else is a bonus
p273_040 People want to see me on the screen
p273_041 Her body was found about four miles from the car
p273_042 I was inspired by two things
p273_043 Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer
p273_044 My fitness was very poor
p273_045 We have to look beyond the very short term
p273_046 The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse
p273_047 I expect a rapid response
p273_048 I must take a seat
p273_049 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p273_050 How are you, sir ?
p273_051 So is that it, then ?
p273_052 Do I have a favourite ?
p273_053 What do we do ?
p273_054 The situation is not easy, but we will prevail
p273_055 Let's hope that it does
p273_056 We have to keep our clients
p273_057 Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London
p273_058 We will pay their bills
p273_059 It was exactly four months away
p273_060 Charles Kennedy had an effective outing
p273_061 I was conceived in Aberdeen
p273_062 Robin Williams is very subdued
p273_063 The spirit in the dressing room is tremendous
p273_064 I was as strong as a horse
p273_065 We should keep this recent assault in perspective
p273_066 They do not work for Glasgow City Council
p273_067 Both sides have been hit by injury
p273_068 The creditors have lost a lot
p273_069 Stephen has never considered the question of compensation
p273_070 Even the one she loved
p273_071 Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat
p273_072 After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction
p273_073 It makes for an interesting conference
p273_074 This view was echoed by another Scottish analyst
p273_075 No progress has been made
p273_076 He has been a success this year
p273_077 They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life
p273_078 We have to offer value for money
p273_079 That should be the subject matter of a public debate
p273_080 It's so hard to shift
p273_081 They lived for their children
p273_082 Potions said he would drive
p273_083 Last weekend was extremely frustrating
p273_084 He had missed a penalty against the English
p273_085 The allegations were still under investigation, he added
p273_086 I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party
p273_087 He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels
p273_088 It was clear on Thursday
p273_089 It was a family tragedy
p273_090 It's not a holiday time for football players
p273_091 They like being on the front pages of the newspapers
p273_092 He was prepared for this
p273_093 Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us
p273_094 We haven't finished the complaints procedure
p273_095 We intend to change the model
p273_096 We should recognise that others have done a good job
p273_097 But the battle has only just begun
p273_098 The following are the principal provisions
p273_099 Before the game we went for a pint
p273_100 Athletics is on a roll in the country
p273_101 I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling
p273_102 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p273_103 We deserve a significant rise
p273_104 Got to win today, though
p273_105 The pressure is on them
p273_106 New Year will be very busy
p273_107 There's still plenty of time left
p273_108 I didn't think so either
p273_109 He thought she was amazing
p273_110 I came here this week to work
p273_111 Then again, we could have
p273_112 Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month
p273_113 Here, again, they were denied a voice
p273_114 We would make a start
p273_115 His job was not advertised
p273_116 This is a frightening development
p273_117 Which can happen any time
p273_118 That is far too high
p273_119 My life has changed a lot
p273_120 Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland
p273_121 That would open the gates of hell
p273_122 You are a gambling man
p273_123 It feels like a privilege
p273_124 That is the ultimate revenge
p273_125 I am totally devoted to this job
p273_126 We'll have to think about it
p273_127 I love the spectacle of cinema
p273_128 The findings are published in the British Journal of Cancer
p273_129 I'm so grateful for that
p273_130 The study is expected to last until the middle of the year
p273_131 There's always the next century
p273_132 There's only one team in Ayrshire
p273_133 The weather forecast isn't good
p273_134 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p273_135 Behind him was his brother
p273_136 She had gone to the Catholic school
p273_137 One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas
p273_138 It would seem a natural progression
p273_139 It was a terrible combination of factors
p273_140 Today is not a victory
p273_141 Why do it otherwise ?
p273_142 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p273_143 So, did she meet him ?
p273_144 So what is the campaign about ?
p273_145 And does it ?
p273_146 Are you from the rugby ?
p273_147 Had I heard ?
p273_148 This action reflects a slump in bookings
p273_149 They should stop the bombing
p273_150 The Internet is no substitute for customer service
p273_151 I'm not going to answer that right now
p273_152 It's never great to finish second
p273_153 The long-term trend is certainly moving towards a balance
p273_154 Further growth will be funded from cash flow
p273_155 They could not match it
p273_156 I always felt they played for me
p273_157 His team management was protective
p273_158 One season, they might do well
p273_159 The jury is still out
p273_160 Phase one was a shambles
p273_161 I did not have a bet on myself
p273_162 It is also very valuable
p273_163 For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo
p273_164 They are determined to make a meaningful contribution
p273_165 Says the Duke of York
p273_166 They bought the property four years ago
p273_167 Hopefully, it will bring new customers
p273_168 DAVID Sutherland does not beat about the bush
p273_169 You know the sort of thing
p273_170 It was a bit like having children
p273_171 It shows the strength of the roots
p273_172 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p273_173 This youngster is so exciting!
p273_174 Two years later, she was dead
p273_175 It's very difficult to find a buyer
p273_176 Neither side would reveal the details of the offer
p273_177 Everyone can have their opinion
p273_178 Because he was born in England
p273_179 I came home by ambulance
p273_180 What happened in that game ?
p273_181 Are you going to win ?
p273_182 Was it the wife ?
p273_183 Why change it ?
p273_184 What do we want to do that for ?
p273_185 We've had an enjoyable adventure
p273_186 It comes from reflection or thinking
p273_187 It was a moment of madness
p273_188 They have the cash and the fire power
p273_189 The company hopes to repeat the process in France
p273_190 The early physical reports were clear
p273_191 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p273_192 The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday
p273_193 It gave no further details
p273_194 Little is known about them
p273_195 I won't make an official complaint
p273_196 British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US
p273_197 It was worth a photograph
p273_198 Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match
p273_199 His injury was completely random
p273_200 HARRY Potter has lost his magic
p273_201 From there, they can go anywhere
p273_202 I'm just a regular person
p273_203 It had all been arranged
p273_204 The statement contained no surprises
p273_205 His third goal was superb
p273_206 It will affect their work
p273_207 I am considered a teenager
p273_208 IT S all change at Kilmarnock
p273_209 There's a chance they might come down
p273_210 The transaction is not feasible
p273_211 He remains a main board director of Royal
p273_212 The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo
p273_213 Investors were also concerned about margin pressure
p273_214 He later paid a tribute to his opponent
p273_216 The cuts were made within an hour of each other
p273_217 William Hague delighted his party
p273_218 You could feel the heat
p273_219 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p273_220 I have spoken to the skipper
p273_221 That was a problem for me
p273_222 The output price index in December was unchanged on November
p273_223 They would have to go to the Royal
p273_224 But he failed to win the committee's support
p273_225 He is obviously very dangerous
p273_226 It depends on Labour, not on us
p273_227 It had so much to do with the output
p273_228 We have not been approached
p273_229 The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high
p273_230 I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight
p273_231 That will be a decision for BBC Scotland
p273_232 Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning
p273_233 Will have consequences for Scottish universities
p273_234 The irony was not lost
p273_235 He said the move followed a downturn in business travel
p273_236 My future is in the marathon
p273_237 Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise
p273_238 We were well worth the win
p273_239 Kingfisher can afford to wait
p273_240 In fact, it is deeply unpleasant
p273_241 Defensive stocks attracted some interest
p273_242 You can feel at home in China
p273_243 Does the name matter ?
p273_244 how do you get it back ?
p273_245 What are you not good at ?
p273_246 I think, therefore I am ?
p273_247 Who was she ?
p273_248 I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record
p273_249 We have no information on Iraq
p273_250 Paterson can afford to be generous
p273_251 Washington is consumed by the crisis
p273_252 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p273_253 It makes no difference to their friendship
p273_254 No production contract is yet in sight
p273_255 It was the climax of the thing
p273_256 We accept the new rules
p273_257 On the contrary they stand to gain
p273_258 It was a minor incident
p273_259 Blair is very positive at European Councils
p273_260 He took over our lives
p273_261 I rejected the idea of a separate residence
p273_262 I'd never run for them
p273_263 Her body has never been found
p273_264 This will look at consumer attitudes
p273_265 He could see no other bidder
p273_266 There's not much money in cycling
p273_267 The demand is created by the supply
p273_268 We're trying to get rounded performers
p273_269 Any error is severely punished
p273_270 Internet users will double over the next three years in the UK
p273_271 Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate
p273_272 It was a horrible moment
p273_273 Truth is the child of time
p273_274 It was an easy decision to come here
p273_275 Similar measures are expected in England and Wales
p273_276 Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years
p273_277 It was never a free kick
p273_278 They failed to reach agreement yesterday
p273_279 This is a great opportunity for us
p273_280 We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service
p273_281 She has fallen in love with Scotland, however
p273_282 You have to expect this type of thing
p273_283 In essence, the teaching profession has a choice
p273_284 It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday
p273_285 Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles
p273_286 The response from everyone was wonderful
p273_287 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p273_288 The circumstances have changed since last year
p273_289 It's all designed to speed up the service
p273_290 We feel very comfortable in this international environment
p273_291 Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure
p273_292 Tony Blair said as little
p273_293 And they were being paid ?
p273_294 was everything done to save the people ?
p273_295 What was the matter for concern ?
p273_296 Do I think about them often ?
p273_297 Is it in the right place ?
p273_298 The rescue package is public money
p273_299 The effect was almost magical
p273_300 I will never change our policy on paying appearance money
p273_301 And that culture is everywhere In Dublin
p273_302 Holland won by five wickets
p273_303 His appeal is instantly understood
p273_304 The songs are just so good
p273_305 I can hardly believe it
p273_306 Saturday's match was fairly straightforward
p273_307 Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear
p273_308 The world record is suspicious
p273_309 I was brought up in a mining background
p273_310 I thought his speech was a disgrace
p273_311 Job losses were also announced
p273_312 I had no intention of misleading anyone
p273_313 The pound has also suffered
p273_314 Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well
p273_316 Scotland has shown the way
p273_317 You are talking about a matter of life and death
p273_318 Leading share prices have also fallen in Paris and Frankfurt
p273_319 The letters are going out today
p273_320 He will go a long way
p273_321 We will listen to any suggestion
p273_322 But it is a slow process
p273_323 The woman is basically off her head
p273_324 Mr Clinton was asked about his memory
p273_325 It looks as though the issue with The Scotsman is too sensitive
p273_326 Other musicians were found in retirement
p273_327 It is a terrible state of affairs
p273_328 Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis
p273_329 That is a trend which will be encouraged
p273_330 They will have to cut through the roof
p273_331 The airport was even different
p273_332 Hopefully, he will get a lucky break
p273_333 He declined to comment on possible disposals
p273_334 Nobody said it was required
p273_335 It was tough to contain the excitement
p273_336 Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow
p273_337 Whether this return was too soon
p273_338 Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items
p273_339 It's wonderful to have won
p273_340 He was at school in Devon
p273_341 Many of these properties are located in the south of England
p273_342 I'd like to take the plunge
p273_343 I have a moral dilemma
p273_344 My view has now completely changed
p273_345 There was a definite prejudice
p273_346 The strong pound also took its toll
p273_347 We have very limited capacity
p273_348 Everything in golf is a balance
p273_349 He can handle it without any problem
p273_350 The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper
p273_351 The Allies intend to maintain the average
p273_352 My mind is focused on the next four weeks
p273_353 We're still the only ones in the High Street
p273_354 He had no previous convictions
p273_355 But the Foreign Secretary can cope
p273_356 I was delighted to accept
p273_357 Do you think we are a top nation ?
p273_358 How independent is that ?
p273_359 Are they free ?
p273_360 Is there a waiting list ?
p273_361 George Mitchell is trying to close the gap
p273_362 But BA said the prediction was premature
p273_363 They should take their mobile phones
p273_364 They have broken that promise
p273_365 That is a crazy situation
p273_366 We are really good friends
p273_367 From our point of view, the player is free to leave
p273_368 Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months
p273_369 The statement finally came on Wednesday night after the market had closed
p273_370 The salary changes are long overdue
p273_371 The major championships will always have a special place
p273_372 They were to blame for the first two goals
p273_373 There is no deal as yet
p273_374 Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited
p273_375 This hasn't happened in a vacuum
p273_376 It was like a weekly wage
p273_377 In due course the deal was done
p273_378 to have products for their needs
p273_379 The pair are very much in love
p273_380 We will win the argument
p273_381 The prosecution say the girl was the only witness to the attack
p273_382 It benefits the whole family
p273_383 Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors
p273_384 It runs until the beginning of June
p273_385 Theatre is not a museum
p273_386 The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account
p273_387 We are satisfied with this outcome
p273_388 We operate as a Scottish company
p273_389 They have not done so this season so far
p273_390 Rugby is a hard game
p273_391 Is it worth it ?
p273_392 Does it matter ?
p273_393 How do you take them away ?
p273_394 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p273_395 After the match, do you ?
p273_396 He put some colour into Scottish history
p273_397 This big issue is whether it can be enforced
p273_398 The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland
p273_399 Clark is back on top form
p273_400 The results will take second place
p273_401 It was a funny game
p273_402 It's too close to call
p273_403 It is a large number
p273_404 She started to put on weight
p273_405 I've had a wonderful career
p273_406 Upgrading the station has been under consideration for some time
p273_407 But the foundations have been laid
p273_408 There was an element of frustration
p273_409 Russell is delighted with them
p273_410 We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre
p273_411 We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow
p273_412 George is on a two-day visit to Scotland
p273_413 I remain a buyer of the shares
p273_414 I would like to continue to develop
p273_415 Family liaison officers are now working to support the family
p273_416 This market has been neglected by the whisky industry
p273_417 There is a solution, she believes
p273_418 That might mean another delay
p273_419 That's been all around Europe with me
p273_420 She's had to suffer for the last six years
p273_421 The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia
p273_422 My aim is a top six finish
p273_423 That means that nobody can do it
p273_424 Such an attack is bizarre
p273_425 At half-time he was presented to both teams
p273_426 No date has been fixed for his return
p273_427 It was a breathtaking moment
p273_428 Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt
p273_429 A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed
p273_430 No-one wanted to run it tonight
p273_431 They are not left wing
p273_432 It is not a standing army
p273_433 Strangely enough I felt very sharp
p273_434 The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment
p273_435 Their condition is described as satisfactory
p273_436 He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review
p274_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p274_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p274_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p274_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p274_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p274_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p274_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p274_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p274_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p274_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p274_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbows in various ways
p274_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p274_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p274_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p274_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky

p274_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p274_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p274_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p274_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p274_025 I can't play the game for them
p274_026 She is employed on short-term contracts
p274_027 Drugs are a serious problem
p274_028 This is a central issue
p274_029 Not if you know the person
p274_030 Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy
p274_031 Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism
p274_032 Costs have got to be controlled
p274_033 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p274_034 Several investments have already been made
p274_035 This represents a tough game for us
p274_036 The boy is no longer with us
p274_037 They said she was stable
p274_038 Among them are many criminals
p274_039 Merger would be entirely logical
p274_040 Well, he is an artist
p274_041 He looks like an Afghan
p274_042 Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts
p274_043 He will need that machine
p274_044 People want to see me on the screen
p274_045 I had come back from London
p274_046 Pulled a huge number of viewers
p274_047 I had trouble with the producers
p274_048 Subsidy income will not be affected
p274_049 We are certainly talking about many millions
p274_050 The outcome of their game isn't the important thing
p274_051 The drivers had an awful lot of verbal abuse
p274_052 The latter were not from Scotland
p274_053 We felt it was sufficient
p274_054 There's still plenty time left
p274_055 The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow

p274_064 There could be a way back
p274_065 Then followed a bout of flu
p274_066 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?)
p274_067 How are you, sir ?)
p274_068 So is that it, then ?)
p274_069 Do I have a favourite ?)
p274_070 What do we do ?)
p274_071 Why do it otherwise ?)
p274_072 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?)
p274_073 Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator
p274_074 I want the Commonwealth and European titles
p274_075 Talk of a crisis is absurd
p274_076 After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction
p274_077 There may be reasons for it
p274_078 I first met him last summer
p274_079 It is the only company of its kind in the UK
p274_080 The ethos of the school was outstanding
p274_081 It took an option on the process
p274_082 We have to offer value for money
p274_083 Our mother is very worried
p274_084 They lived for their children
p274_085 It wasn't possible to relax
p274_086 This is a complex and detailed report
p274_087 Tony Blair said as little
p274_088 The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation
p274_089 The processing plant was closed yesterday
p274_090 I have every confidence in Raymond Robertson as chairman of the party
p274_091 That will bring about a dramatic improvement
p274_092 It was clear on Thursday
p274_093 It was a family tragedy
p274_094 He is not a dancer
p274_095 It is for policy Ministers to defend their policies
p274_096 In the end we made too many errors
p274_097 The following are the principal provisions
p274_098 I did not concentrate on my performance
p274_099 But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant
p274_100 Before the game we went for a pint
p274_101 Our house was very small
p274_102 I did not think about the Ryder Cup
p274_103 I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling
p274_104 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p274_105 According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland
p274_106 Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National
p274_107 We deserve a significant rise
p274_108 Here the jury is still out
p274_109 This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service
p274_110 We have a team to reach the final
p274_111 You can spend money on housing
p274_112 It's not a quick fix
p274_113 Structural changes were also required
p274_114 It was a good game to watch
p274_115 However, the problem is the timing
p274_116 Which can happen any time
p274_117 We had another last Tuesday
p274_118 This should begin in October
p274_119 I was on a roll
p274_120 There is no evidence that these people are helpful
p274_121 That is far too high
p274_122 He said to give a local injection
p274_123 What happened in that game ?)
p274_124 Are you going to win ?)
p274_125 Was it the wife ?)
p274_126 Why change it ?)
p274_127 What do we want to do that for ?)
p274_128 Does the name matter ?)
p274_129 how do you get it back ?)
p274_130 That would open the gates of hell
p274_131 The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday
p274_132 I feel very grateful with everything
p274_133 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p274_134 This is a major championship
p274_135 I love the spectacle of cinema
p274_136 This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely
p274_137 It's going to take some time
p274_138 I think he's the favourite, no question
p274_139 It is a vicious circle
p274_140 The BBC was a disgrace
p274_141 But she was very human
p274_142 The referee faces a massive job
p274_143 Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis
p274_144 There is no mandate for a regime change
p274_145 No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday
p274_146 The whole industry is a shambles
p274_147 We have to speed up the process
p274_148 There's only one team in Ayrshire
p274_149 I prefer the clarity of the existing system
p274_150 The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms
p274_151 It is ambitious, but it can be achieved
p274_152 It was by the numbers
p274_153 And sooner than we may think
p274_154 The abuse of elderly people was appalling
p274_155 The danger is always there
p274_156 Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics
p274_157 They should stop the bombing
p274_158 Scotland came very close in the second Test
p274_159 Full back was a bit of the unknown
p274_160 The strong performance is expected to continue
p274_161 He was in great spirits
p274_162 We came across the first set of bodies
p274_163 Overall, the labour market continued to tighten
p274_164 But it is different in different regions
p274_165 Further growth will be funded from cash flow
p274_166 They had been forced to walk
p274_167 The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups
p274_168 It's not good at all
p274_169 You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions
p274_170 But the petrol station does not get the benefit
p274_171 If that's the case, he will struggle
p274_173 I'm just going to hit the shot
p274_174 Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked
p274_175 They are determined to make a meaningful contribution
p274_176 Says the Duke of York
p274_177 And they were being paid ?)
p274_178 was everything done to save people ?)
p274_179 What was the matter for concern ?)
p274_180 Do I think about them often ?)
p274_181 Is it in the right place ?)
p274_182 Did he trip ?)
p274_183 They bought the property four years ago
p274_184 Miller was every bit as happy
p274_185 Women were mostly notable by their absence
p274_186 They responded well after the run of defeats
p274_187 It could be done by experts and lawyers
p274_188 The interim dividend has been passed
p274_189 But there's an upturn in the sector
p274_190 Aberdeen had little to offer
p274_191 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p274_192 I'm interested in interesting work
p274_193 We represent a wide range of society
p274_194 Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender
p274_195 It's very difficult to find a buyer
p274_196 Neither side would reveal the details of the offer
p274_197 But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner
p274_198 Everyone can have their opinion
p274_199 He should emerge as the winner
p274_200 It comes from reflection or thinking
p274_201 That might mean another delay
p274_202 The early physical reports were clear
p274_203 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p274_204 The result is utterly compelling
p274_205 The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office
p274_206 I won't make an official complaint
p274_207 It was worth a photograph
p274_208 Which isn't a bad idea
p274_209 We have an election in eight days
p274_210 Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match
p274_211 They have known the hard times
p274_212 Today we must not repeat that mistake
p274_213 It's easy to be negative about these things
p274_214 Basically, they have to come up with the offer
p274_215 I am considered a teenager
p274_216 However, Dundee deserved to win this game
p274_217 That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic
p274_218 It was a crazy day
p274_219 People should make their own decisions
p274_220 The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo
p274_221 The red card was okay
p274_222 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife

p274_224 We have not given up hope
p274_225 Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray
p274_226 William Hague delighted his party
p274_227 We played them off the pitch
p274_228 The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions
p274_229 The output price index in December was unchanged on November
p274_230 The performance continues to improve
p274_231 A small number of new jobs will also be created
p274_232 They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house
p274_233 He does not much like the Liberal Democrats
p274_234 It depends on Labour, not on us
p274_235 Paterson can afford to be generous
p274_236 Wilson will tell the truth
p274_237 The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high
p274_238 Customers would then be consulted over any changes
p274_239 Those overseas offices were great
p274_240 You will have seen the adverts
p274_241 Half of young people had had contact with the police
p274_242 It will now be revived
p274_243 I was released after six days
p274_244 Three weeks later, he resigned
p274_245 Others agreed with this view
p274_246 I was just a kid
p274_247 There were no reports of casualties
p274_248 Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter
p274_249 The effects are not all bad
p274_250 He would not impose a fine
p274_251 Does that put pressure on us ?)
p274_252 Did it work ?)
p274_253 Do you think we are a top nation ?)
p274_254 Is our children learning ?)
p274_255 How independent is that ?)
p274_256 What form did that take ?)
p274_257 Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise
p274_258 Kingfisher can afford to wait
p274_259 A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe
p274_260 Labour was too busy to respond
p274_261 You can feel at home in China
p274_262 He will go a long way
p274_263 We have no information on Iraq
p274_264 Either way, the investor retains the premium
p274_266 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p274_267 I should think so, too
p274_268 This will save interest charges
p274_269 No production contract is yet in sight
p274_270 Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland
p274_271 He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen
p274_272 This idea has been around for four years
p274_273 The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow
p274_274 We accept the new rules
p274_275 He is quite well organised
p274_276 I couldn't honestly tell you
p274_277 On the contrary they stand to gain
p274_278 Quality was high in all sections
p274_279 He took over our lives
p274_280 I rejected the idea of a separate residence
p274_281 This will look at consumer attitudes
p274_282 It is also very valuable
p274_283 There's not much money in cycling
p274_284 My main intention was to write a funny comedy
p274_285 None of this work is guaranteed
p274_286 Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention
p274_287 It has raised the profile of Scottish banking
p274_288 They can leave at any time
p274_289 It opens the door to the Champions League
p274_290 It has the potential to be another North Sea
p274_291 Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate
p274_292 Frankly, we should all have such problems
p274_293 And Michael was just great
p274_294 Strikers like to go to the ground
p274_295 This is a great opportunity for us
p274_296 We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service
p274_297 It's called the Supreme Court for a reason
p274_298 You have to expect this type of thing
p274_299 It is a flexible concept
p274_300 The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened
p274_301 And we were very lucky
p274_302 So the Government will be damaged
p274_303 The partnership was set up during the summer
p274_304 There's nothing I can say
p274_305 Her body was found on Monday morning
p274_306 We will deliver at director level
p274_307 They have shown a great desire and attitude
p274_308 I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh
p274_309 Maloney is an engaging talent
p274_310 The rescue package is public money
p274_311 Clydesdale Bank declined to comment
p274_312 Everything in golf is a balance
p274_313 The weather will be unpredictable if anything
p274_314 His appeal is instantly understood
p274_315 The songs are just so good
p274_316 Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme
p274_317 Saturday's match was fairly straightforward
p274_318 Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear
p274_319 McNaughton was not so sure
p274_320 Are they free ?)
p274_321 What are they for ?)
p274_322 Is there a waiting list ?)
p274_323 Do they think anyone else wants them ?)
p274_324 So what happens next ?)
p274_325 Had this been common practice ?)
p274_326 What do they want us to do ?)
p274_327 Is it worth it ?)
p274_328 There was no hint of scandal
p274_329 I was brought up in a mining background
p274_330 We're not an employment agency
p274_331 She had gone to the Catholic school
p274_332 But I have been told that rugby playing numbers are up again
p274_333 The group is not paying a dividend
p274_334 Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well
p274_335 He has left the company
p274_336 And he goes with it
p274_337 There will be good prospects ahead
p274_338 It is a court case
p274_339 There is a handful of rewarding paintings
p274_340 This is a historic occasion
p274_341 Writing has diminished in value
p274_342 That's the way it goes
p274_343 After some discussion they did
p274_344 No one wants a dispute
p274_345 Our season is not finished
p274_346 Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed
p274_347 The business model is actually very exciting
p274_348 There was some merit in that
p274_349 That is a trend which will be encouraged
p274_350 Other people had looked at it
p274_351 He declined to comment on possible disposals
p274_352 It was tough to contain the excitement
p274_353 Either team will be hard
p274_354 The pain is still acute
p274_355 Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items
p274_356 It's wonderful to have won
p274_357 This might seem like an outrageous assertion
p274_358 Governments will have to respond
p274_359 We have very limited capacity
p274_360 It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped
p274_361 It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem
p274_362 We are in a global market
p274_363 The Allies intend to maintain the average
p274_364 Italy was just behind the US
p274_365 It was a unanimous decision
p274_366 Do not forget about Monaco
p274_367 He had no previous convictions
p274_368 But the Foreign Secretary can cope
p274_369 I got a yellow card
p274_370 Does it matter ?)
p274_371 How do you take them away ?)
p274_372 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?)
p274_373 After the match, do you ?)
p274_374 It had been a magical moment
p274_375 From our point of view, the player is free to leave
p274_376 Yesterday was a statement of intent
p274_377 Those people must be accountable
p274_378 Rangers can expect a physical battle in the national stadium tonight
p274_379 Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited
p274_380 Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat
p274_381 This hasn't happened in a vacuum
p274_382 Both of those promises have already been honoured
p274_383 It was like a weekly wage
p274_384 In addition, it was in breach of natural justice
p274_385 It will be completed within a year
p274_386 The pair are very much in love
p274_387 Everything is now in place for Manchester
p274_388 The group will also become an Internet service provider
p274_389 Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors
p274_390 Glasgow University declined to comment
p274_391 It runs until the beginning of June
p274_392 He has earned the right to their respect
p274_393 The law would appear to be on our side
p274_394 The board meetings will be held in Edinburgh
p274_396 There was a substantial explosion
p274_397 It's never great to finish second
p274_398 Finally, he paid for the movie
p274_399 The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account
p274_400 It has only been rumours
p274_401 He put some colour into Scottish history
p274_402 Clark is back on top form
p274_403 We're not taking any risks
p274_404 Neither man has been charged
p274_405 The members have voted against it
p274_406 It's too close to call
p274_407 Nobody will be forced to work
p274_408 I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson
p274_409 I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters
p274_410 I've had a wonderful career
p274_411 However, the players should have a voice in these matters
p274_412 Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents
p274_413 But the foundations have been laid
p274_414 That is the ultimate revenge
p274_415 It's just a training thing
p274_416 A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire
p274_417 They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune
p274_418 George is on a two-day visit to Scotland
p274_419 The second goal was superb
p274_420 Hopefully, the answer is in the positive
p274_421 I was pleased with my own game
p274_422 This market has been neglected by the whisky industry
p274_423 This should put downward pressure on inflation
p274_424 Not that Scotland can claim the moral high ground
p274_425 The projections are very positive for South Africa
p274_426 Being captain of this club is fantastic
p274_427 Such an attack is bizarre
p274_428 It needs to be volatile
p274_429 I never had a childhood
p274_430 The need for any new UN resolutions will be put on hold
p274_431 A police spokeswoman said last night that the case was closed
p274_432 The trial will open today
p274_433 There is another important factor
p274_434 This is a limited market
p274_435 Its failure is no surprise
p274_436 No doubt the council would welcome the proposal
p274_437 The Festival is prepared to help
p274_438 Strangely enough I felt very sharp
p274_439 His message was very simple
p274_440 The boat was fully equipped with safety equipment
p274_441 I didn't get to keep it
p274_442 Their condition is described as satisfactory
p274_443 Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities
p274_444 They are interior designers and architects
p274_445 Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra
p274_446 It wouldn't matter if he had
p274_447 No further details of expansion plans were given
p274_448 The villagers were shot in the head at short range
p274_449 It is pretty bad news
p274_450 We just thought it would be kept under the carpet
p274_451 It could cause a little bit of disruption
p274_452 But we have built a platform for next season
p274_453 I think the goalkeeper should have gone
p274_454 We think a lot of Allan McGregor
p274_455 It was like someone had died
p274_456 They offer a kind of narrative
p274_457 We're still the only ones in the High Street
p274_458 A fatal accident inquiry is ongoing
p274_459 Now that business is banned
p274_460 Let that be their memorial
p274_461 The boys are mentally focused
p274_462 Driving has been the key
p274_463 It's because they can't understand the language
p274_464 Then came the farewell to Europe
p274_465 The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue
p274_466 Phil Mickelson did that last year
p274_467 The answer was up there on the stage
p274_468 It recommended that they reject the proposed legislation
p274_469 He will not be involved in school discipline
p274_470 You have to have a proven track record to get them
p276_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p276_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p276_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p276_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p276_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p276_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p276_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p276_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p276_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p276_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p276_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p276_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p276_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p276_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p276_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p276_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p276_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p276_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p276_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p276_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p276_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p276_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p276_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p276_025 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p276_026 How are you, sir ?
p276_027 So is that it, then ?
p276_028 Do I have a favourite ?
p276_029 What do we do ?
p276_030 They might have asked, for goodness sake
p276_031 Smoking is also very important
p276_032 We have the support of Scottish Natural Heritage
p276_033 Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected
p276_034 He said police inquiries should not be conducted as political opportunism
p276_035 There was a rush of water
p276_036 A fiver and I'll tell
p276_037 We speak about the performance
p276_038 She is employed on short-term contracts
p276_039 Further management changes are planned
p276_040 I can feel the sound inside
p276_041 Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy
p276_042 He is married with three children
p276_043 I might well have done so already
p276_044 This is slightly negative for inflation
p276_045 And they had a case
p276_046 We believe a third party was involved
p276_047 Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism
p276_048 It carried a double message
p276_049 Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing
p276_050 But not a penny has been paid
p276_051 Perhaps it is eyeing a mortgage bank
p276_052 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p276_053 The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager
p276_054 Surrender is not an appealing or realistic prospect
p276_055 This represents a tough game for us
p276_056 They have shown a great desire and attitude
p276_057 Among them are many criminals
p276_058 And they removed a Borderer
p276_059 He is too weak to move
p276_060 Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight
p276_061 They desperately want some stability
p276_062 Everything is possible in football
p276_063 We like being the underdogs
p276_064 He looks like an Afghan
p276_065 This trend is likely to strengthen
p276_066 He will need that machine
p276_067 Then they scored two goals to win
p276_068 Both banks are heavily involved in the Scottish market
p276_069 Pulled a huge number of viewers
p276_070 The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government
p276_071 Let's not be too despondent
p276_072 There was no safety net
p276_073 The Government does not go far enough
p276_074 He phoned the number in the brochure
p276_075 A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said
p276_076 He confirmed that the document was valid
p276_077 The wingers must have felt the cold
p276_078 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p276_079 I have made that offer
p276_080 Why do it otherwise ?
p276_081 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p276_082 So, did she meet him ?
p276_083 So what is the campaign about ?
p276_084 The new deal will now be put to the officers
p276_085 Carlton also declined to comment last night
p276_086 But the organisers refused to worry
p276_087 Webster was brought up in Glasgow
p276_088 Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions
p276_089 Autumn is the time of fulfilment
p276_090 The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee
p276_091 He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it
p276_092 Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles
p276_093 Funding needs to be long term
p276_094 We should all be grateful
p276_095 He's not getting into any games
p276_096 The coach is a man who is very ambitious
p276_097 We are talking about the outskirts of London
p276_098 It was exactly four months away
p276_099 This is equally relevant to the landowner
p276_100 THE Farmer wants a new campaign
p276_101 We are satisfied with this outcome
p276_102 Robin Williams is very subdued
p276_103 It wasn't possible to relax
p276_104 Context is also very important
p276_105 There could be a way back
p276_106 They do not work for Glasgow City Council
p276_107 Both sides have been hit by injury
p276_108 People had been talking about a fourth quarter rally
p276_109 Even the one she loved
p276_110 Talk of a crisis is absurd
p276_111 He's been active in Arabia
p276_112 England were ahead until two minutes into injury time
p276_113 Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat
p276_114 It is sometimes like that
p276_115 He was unprepared for this fight
p276_116 I've had it for the exams
p276_117 Those people must be accountable
p276_118 If they liked it then I'll be happy
p276_119 It's very bad timing, but it's happened
p276_120 Choice is a good thing
p276_121 I am not very pleased
p276_122 New Zealand rugby is totally different
p276_123 Petrol prices were widely blamed
p276_124 Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat
p276_125 Accordingly, financial restructuring is required
p276_126 Many others are subjected to violence by men
p276_127 Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed
p276_128 Florida is the pivotal state in the nation
p276_129 They lived for their children
p276_130 Potions said he would drive
p276_131 Diversions were put in place
p276_132 The Queen Mother is dead
p276_133 No one person or small group could be singled out
p276_134 The excitement could hardly be contained
p276_135 Margins are also in retreat
p276_136 Dancing will help his ankles and his feet
p276_137 He had missed a penalty against the English
p276_138 The outsourcing deal will take effect in September
p276_139 I was deeply saddened by the death of Donald Dewar
p276_140 It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed
p276_141 Cutting ticket prices would certainly help
p276_142 We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football
p276_143 Absences should be carefully monitored
p276_144 Four meetings have previously been arranged
p276_145 The rise in retail sales was the first since August
p276_146 Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future
p276_147 We just have to adapt
p276_148 Are you from the rugby ?
p276_149 What happened in that game ?
p276_150 Are you going to win ?
p276_151 Was it the wife ?
p276_152 Why change it ?
p276_153 And they all have a vote
p276_154 But they must believe in themselves
p276_155 Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us
p276_156 Token gestures of tiny tax cuts will not do
p276_157 We made a world record together
p276_158 This is the logic of punishment assaults
p276_159 But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant
p276_160 That was the first time I worked with Richard
p276_161 They said so that I would look good in uniform
p276_162 A good actor doesn't think
p276_163 That's what happened against Ayr
p276_164 Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly
p276_165 He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by
p276_166 It is a good lifestyle
p276_167 Before the game we went for a pint
p276_168 City sentiment is in his favour
p276_169 His job was not advertised
p276_170 Nato has left them with no other option
p276_171 Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive
p276_172 He was just like a godfather to it
p276_173 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p276_174 Yet the survey has been cautious
p276_175 These people are now following their own Unison agenda
p276_176 It took five months to repair the damage
p276_177 They exist in name alone
p276_178 Advice and counselling will be offered
p276_179 You had better believe it
p276_180 It was a sobering experience
p276_181 I can see it now
p276_182 There's still plenty time left
p276_183 Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee
p276_184 I've no idea how it works
p276_185 The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost
p276_186 The festivals will be about having fun
p276_187 This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service
p276_188 She is in good spirits
p276_189 The changes took effect from June
p276_190 As if that is an achievement
p276_191 That will be the sweetness
p276_192 Sacking John Redwood is a disaster
p276_193 Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month
p276_194 There was a fossil on screen
p276_195 The protest will go ahead as planned
p276_196 I did not concentrate on my performance
p276_197 The feedback from them has been fantastic
p276_198 That admission is not surprising
p276_199 But he rejected calls for a public register of paedophiles
p276_200 However, the problem is the timing
p276_201 Again he dismissed a merger with Halifax
p276_202 That was just one night
p276_203 This is a frightening development
p276_204 They keep the atmosphere in mind
p276_205 Millions of British jobs depend on Europe
p276_206 Sloppy answers are to be avoided
p276_207 That is an entirely unacceptable position
p276_208 My father died in childbirth
p276_209 It is quite a thing to watch
p276_210 This should begin in October
p276_211 Twaddle is a case in point
p276_212 The Yugoslav army will still be there
p276_213 Some promoters made insulting offers
p276_214 We did what we had to do
p276_215 The squad is too small
p276_216 What do we want to do that for ?
p276_217 Does the name matter ?
p276_218 how do you get it back ?
p276_219 What are you not good at ?
p276_220 I think, therefore I am ?
p276_221 You've got to be vigilant
p276_222 I learned that only yesterday
p276_223 It's been a humbling year
p276_224 Nicolson is no stranger to the Highlands
p276_225 You are a gambling man
p276_226 Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces
p276_227 My daughter is an adult
p276_228 I would not say that
p276_229 There was a fine line to tread
p276_230 The refund is fully justified
p276_231 I've been asked that already, this morning - on the radio
p276_232 I never wanted a legal battle
p276_233 It would make a lot of sense
p276_234 It was started almost by accident
p276_235 The partnership was set up during the summer
p276_236 Bottling is now the core business
p276_237 She died at her home
p276_238 Had this been common practice ?
p276_239 What do they want us to do ?
p276_240 Is it worth it ?
p276_241 Does it matter ?
p276_242 How do you take them away ?
p276_243 Frankly, it was worth the booking
p276_244 People have been wonderful beyond belief
p276_245 We were right to be afraid
p276_247 That group reported just before Christmas
p276_248 Five minutes later, the home team were back in front
p276_249 Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes
p276_250 I COULD tell that Alastair Wilkie was energised
p276_251 That view has not altered
p276_252 No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday
p276_253 For business, the benefits will be enormous
p276_254 The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups
p276_255 Five years later, the deception continued
p276_256 Finding suitable replacements would not be easy
p276_257 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p276_258 I felt we deserved the three points
p276_259 Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow
p276_260 They've got some extremely good players
p276_261 Mr Blair had done well
p276_262 She had gone to the Catholic school
p276_263 Then we will face the Danish champions
p276_264 The family kept away from me
p276_265 I would have been shot dead in bed
p276_266 One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas
p276_267 The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible
p276_268 We will turn the corner
p276_269 Of course, it is a tough assignment
p276_270 My Dad is a hero
p276_271 And they were being paid ?
p276_272 was everything done to save people ?
p276_273 What was the matter for concern ?
p276_274 Do I think about them often ?
p276_275 Is it in the right place ?
p276_276 Did he trip ?
p276_277 This wasn't just a big crowd
p276_278 It was a terrible combination of factors
p276_279 This is absolutely not true
p276_280 This might seem like an outrageous assertion
p276_281 They should stop the bombing
p276_282 Sunday's game against Celtic is huge
p276_283 I've come here for the jersey
p276_284 The question is whether private investors should follow their example
p276_285 The strong performance is expected to continue
p276_286 Their extinction is not inevitable
p276_287 It's never great to finish second
p276_288 And, finally, I have good news for the songbirds of Glasgow
p276_289 It's as eventful as it is momentous
p276_290 We have a budget in March
p276_291 Initial market reaction was close to euphoric
p276_292 However, he urged the trade to keep the faith
p276_293 That would open the gates of hell
p276_294 Bobby Williamson has been brilliant
p276_295 We've made a couple of albums
p276_296 A more exhaustive analysis is in progress
p276_297 We have to keep our clients
p276_298 Manchester United can win the European Cup this season
p276_299 First, the programme was unbalanced
p276_300 Everything else is a bonus
p276_301 This championship is different from the other majors
p276_302 At the top level, the salaries are far too high
p276_303 Harrowing is easy, after all
p276_304 Each case is treated on merit
p276_305 A winter of discontent awaits
p276_306 They are determined to make a meaningful contribution
p276_307 I am astonished at attack
p276_308 Says the Duke of York
p276_309 Our destiny is in our own hands
p276_310 Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager
p276_311 Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute
p276_312 She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport
p276_313 We've had great things in the past
p276_314 It could be done by experts and lawyers
p276_315 It was horrible, that musical apartheid
p276_316 It has been recorded twice
p276_317 Aberdeen had little to offer
p276_318 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p276_319 I'm interested in interesting work
p276_320 We represent a wide range of society
p276_321 It caused a lot of upset
p276_322 I saw them last week
p276_323 Does that put pressure on us ?
p276_324 Did it work ?
p276_325 Do you think we are a top nation ?
p276_326 Is our children learning ?
p276_327 How independent is that ?
p276_328 What form did that take ?
p276_329 Are they free ?
p276_330 Friday night was a pretty good night
p276_331 This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds
p276_332 You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice
p276_333 We are trying to clarify the issues
p276_334 I was inspired by two things
p276_335 The Government has completely lost control of GM crops
p276_336 MOVIE stars are public property
p276_337 It comes from reflection or thinking
p276_338 That moment when the monster is being brought to life
p276_339 Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer
p276_340 Tell me today and I will make a business decision tomorrow
p276_341 Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon
p276_342 The company hopes to repeat the process in France
p276_343 And we have the experience
p276_344 The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions
p276_345 This included a downward revision in the expected level of dividend
p276_346 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p276_347 You just have to give yourself a chance
p276_348 They would be supported by visiting specialists
p276_349 You have caught a serial killer
p276_350 I won't make an official complaint
p276_351 It was worth a photograph
p276_352 I grew up with that in the amateur game
p276_353 The move follows a review of the Singapore
p276_354 They make a selective perception process
p276_355 Employees may be taken on at Livingston
p276_356 There is no quick fix
p276_357 What are they for ?
p276_358 Is there a waiting list ?
p276_359 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p276_360 So what happens next ?
p276_361 Thereafter they were allowed to proceed
p276_362 Walker plans to return indoors
p276_363 It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years
p276_364 He worked there for six months
p276_365 HARRY Potter has lost his magic
p276_366 The business has expanded rapidly, however
p276_367 From there, they can go anywhere
p276_368 I had relied on him
p276_369 Truth is the child of time
p276_370 The Reporter appears to have undue influence on the panel
p276_372 Anyway, the job will be part-time
p276_373 Brown has always protested his innocence
p276_374 And the World Cup has not even begun
p276_375 He remains a main board director of Royal
p276_376 This is the version which appeared in our paper
p276_377 Instead, he missed the lot
p276_378 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p276_379 Laura is an investment banker
p276_380 Market research indicates that this is not feasible
p276_381 Women were mostly notable by their absence
p276_382 His background is firmly in venture capital
p276_383 We played them off the pitch
p276_384 But the rally was short-lived
p276_385 McCall is unlikely to change a winning team
p276_386 It must be tough to live with
p276_387 The statement contained no surprises
p276_388 Six other people were injured
p276_389 He said the winner had been chosen by consensus
p276_390 We can't give any figures for Edinburgh
p276_391 Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh
p276_392 They would have to go to the Royal
p276_393 It didn't matter who was in their way
p276_394 He ended up a headmaster
p276_395 North African countries are also seen as potential customers
p276_396 He is obviously very dangerous
p276_397 The most important thing in theatre is to listen
p276_398 That remains the unanswered question
p276_399 You should always be able to get out in some direction
p276_400 It depends on Labour, not on us
p276_401 It had so much to do with output
p276_402 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p276_403 After the match, do you ?
p276_404 Has the conflict started ?
p276_405 Have I really come to this ?
p276_406 David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme
p276_407 Its failure is no surprise
p276_408 It has to be enforced
p276_409 Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families
p276_410 Those overseas offices were great
p276_411 You will have seen the adverts
p276_412 Recent reports suggested it might be sold off
p276_413 Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie
p276_414 No plans for projects are yet in place
p276_415 Three weeks later, he resigned
p276_416 A succession of managers in the opera company resigned
p276_417 Venus rejects the very suggestion
p276_418 A, The media has been great
p276_419 Everything has its place and purpose
p276_420 I have received no explanation
p276_421 Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country
p276_422 He also launched a new strategy for the agency
p276_423 You didn't need to pay
p276_424 The might be rolled out
p276_425 But nothing could be done
p276_426 They made such decisions in London
p276_427 Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential
p276_428 It seems a waste of talents
p276_429 Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service
p276_430 This would discourage investment and job creation
p276_431 We have no information on Iraq
p276_432 If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help
p276_433 George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision
p276_434 The company declined to comment
p276_435 It makes no difference to their friendship
p276_436 They make the right decisions
p276_437 I always savour the company of The Voice
p276_438 It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused
p276_439 Today has been a good day for Northern Ireland
p276_440 I got a yellow card
p276_441 It's an option, but I can't really comment
p276_442 Not many people like to do that
p276_443 He now lives in Fenwick in Ayrshire
p276_444 I might also completely change the routine
p276_445 We accept the new rules
p276_446 He was due to retire in December
p276_447 We go there with confidence
p276_448 They are interior designers and architects
p276_449 He was released after treatment
p276_450 I rejected the idea of a separate residence
p276_451 When I was four years old I used to do like this
p276_452 They can now see the rewards for working hard at the game
p276_453 I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me
p276_454 They must play for each other
p276_455 We are aiming for early March
p276_456 Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia
p276_457 The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high
p276_458 It will take place in July
p276_459 There's not much money in cycling
p276_460 We will pay their bills
p276_461 This court has made an order which has not been observed
p276_462 It was very positive and very helpful
p276_463 Now we see no mention of rising rates
p276_464 Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday
p276_465 We are having a look
p277_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p277_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p277_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p277_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p277_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p277_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p277_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p277_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p277_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p277_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p277_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p277_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p277_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p277_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p277_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p277_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p277_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p277_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p277_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p277_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p277_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p277_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p277_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p277_025 People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background
p277_026 Is this accurate?
p277_027 They have no history
p277_028 Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected
p277_029 The abuse of elderly people was appalling
p277_030 There's a story, too
p277_031 This is the window
p277_032 He was jailed for five years
p277_033 Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist
p277_034 We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude
p277_035 Then, suddenly, they weren't
p277_036 Was it worth it?
p277_037 Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night
p277_038 However, they continued in their pursuit of victory
p277_039 We have to pull together, or we will hang apart
p277_040 They're just different
p277_041 Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack
p277_042 A quality audit officer has also been appointed
p277_043 Indeed, he does
p277_044 I did not see any reason to change the captain
p277_045 He's just in it for himself
p277_046 However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials
p277_047 It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside
p277_048 We will push
p277_049 Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion
p277_050 This represents a tough game for us
p277_051 It is bizarre
p277_052 They said she was stable
p277_053 Is a drug dealer?
p277_054 The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids
p277_055 He is too weak to move
p277_056 They were on holiday in Egypt
p277_057 He looks like an Afghan
p277_058 No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death
p277_059 Here's a clue
p277_060 It had been in place since last July
p277_061 Next league matches Celtic
p277_062 There was no safety net
p277_063 It is unique
p277_064 That's the truth
p277_065 They are ready
p277_066 We need the chief medical officer to clarify the matter
p277_067 I feel I did not have enough time
p277_068 The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow
p277_069 George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision
p277_070 They are real
p277_071 Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued
p277_072 That was a gold medal for certain
p277_073 He was popular
p277_074 But I've won both ways
p277_075 There was an e-mail
p277_076 Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p277_077 Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses
p277_078 Painful, but only because it's true
p277_079 I had my suspicions
p277_080 He was at home with his pals
p277_081 It was magic
p277_082 The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow
p277_083 It is a job creation scheme
p277_084 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p277_085 Even the one she loved
p277_086 Today she has been released
p277_087 He is in the queue
p277_088 He liked to give the impression of being a hard man
p277_089 What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p277_090 Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money
p277_091 Someone who cares
p277_092 By then, he was walking on water
p277_093 It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats
p277_094 It is a blow
p277_095 Florida is the pivotal state in the nation
p277_096 They lived for their children
p277_097 Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today
p277_098 Today I couldn't run on it
p277_099 This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit
p277_100 I was a spectator, that is as far as it goes
p277_101 It was clear
p277_102 It is annoying
p277_103 But I was wrong
p277_104 I love the Dome
p277_105 We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football
p277_106 Our position remains unchanged
p277_107 I wish I had put on a brighter tie
p277_108 Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights
p277_109 Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults
p277_110 You should be
p277_111 After that time, the market itself will set the prices
p277_112 Two of the team became ill
p277_113 He takes the job
p277_114 She reflects a bit
p277_115 I am just trying to do my job
p277_116 Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday
p277_117 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p277_118 I was fighting for my life, I thought
p277_119 Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals
p277_120 It is so sad
p277_121 The mood is upbeat
p277_122 It is rubbish
p277_123 That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships
p277_124 There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end
p277_125 Who would have?
p277_126 There were no grounds for his action
p277_127 I can't even get into the A team
p277_128 I'm so angry
p277_129 She really suffered for her art
p277_130 It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation
p277_131 The task force continues to be in discussion with both companies
p277_132 No production was achieved
p277_133 The BBC was a disgrace
p277_134 This tour is critical for New Zealand rugby
p277_135 It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work
p277_136 The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday
p277_137 Police could not say if the two incidents were connected
p277_138 Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October
p277_139 On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door
p277_140 It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions
p277_141 I had decided to quit the show
p277_142 We want to keep the pound
p277_143 Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray
p277_144 And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life
p277_145 Who would be right?
p277_146 She died at her home
p277_147 He realises his mistake
p277_148 The role of the law lords would be retained
p277_149 It is not just about pay
p277_150 Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday
p277_151 So I got a blood test
p277_152 It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment
p277_153 But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company
p277_154 I was so nervous
p277_155 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p277_156 The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday
p277_157 We also enjoyed a lot of support
p277_158 We are on a four-year mission
p277_159 They should come clean
p277_160 My Dad is a hero
p277_161 He can do no wrong
p277_162 Well, he should know
p277_163 It is so unfair
p277_164 I will tell you
p277_165 I've put my own money into this project
p277_166 Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks
p277_167 It is not like us
p277_168 We've all had the shots
p277_169 It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful
p277_170 Again, we were lucky
p277_171 Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final
p277_172 Does that put pressure on us?
p277_173 It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate
p277_174 They might be broken, but they are not defeated
p277_175 As we worked
p277_176 Tony had arrived
p277_177 And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience
p277_178 Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted
p277_179 It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area
p277_180 They need to look after themselves
p277_181 I saw military vehicles in the distance
p277_182 What has caused the demise of singing?
p277_183 Our team is just so young
p277_184 Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval
p277_185 Suddenly, the rugby world had changed
p277_186 Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender
p277_187 But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections
p277_188 Peace was won
p277_189 It's a fact
p277_190 The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address
p277_191 We believe a third party was involved
p277_192 On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult
p277_193 Tommy is not a problem
p277_194 I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February
p277_195 But she might be
p277_196 I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling
p277_197 It was worth a photograph
p277_198 They make a selective perception process
p277_199 We have an election in eight days
p277_200 Even a shopping trip was a cause for excitement
p277_201 This gives a financial incentive to switch
p277_202 The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors
p277_203 Twaddle is a case in point
p277_204 A Grampian Police spokesman said
p277_205 He sees a difference in the style of the two teams
p277_206 In each case they were a goal down
p277_207 I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery
p277_208 However, Dundee deserved to win this game
p277_209 The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers
p277_210 The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo
p277_211 Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E
p277_212 I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision
p277_213 At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher
p277_214 You should always be able to get out in some direction
p277_215 It's not before time
p277_216 The report is due out next month
p277_217 But she was
p277_218 Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern
p277_219 At the time, he was a living legend
p277_220 They must do it
p277_221 Dewar was certainly under attack from within his own party
p277_222 However, no further action was taken by police
p277_223 Until they came to do it
p277_224 Half of young people had had contact with the police
p277_225 Well, they were the unlucky ones
p277_226 There is no excuse
p277_228 On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence
p277_229 But it's a subtle process
p277_230 He also launched a new strategy for the agency
p277_231 Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order
p277_232 In fact, it is deeply unpleasant
p277_233 A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe
p277_234 It is hard won
p277_235 Our policy is clear
p277_236 The scene is about this?
p277_237 The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery
p277_238 There wasn't a goal
p277_239 I should think so, too
p277_240 There's the mix
p277_241 The concerns are the same
p277_242 I can't get a job
p277_243 For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique
p277_244 It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit
p277_245 However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely
p277_246 One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning
p277_248 Is that a serious question?
p277_249 This is the first step
p277_250 They must play for each other
p277_251 Souter will be back
p277_252 George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks
p277_253 Blood samples were taken
p277_254 They want to shut the Scottish Office
p277_255 We shall rely on human beings
p277_256 This is a question of Islam
p277_257 He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant
p277_258 Immediate action must be taken
p277_259 It's very nice
p277_260 He was also married with two children
p277_261 The system can work
p277_262 It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence
p277_263 We're in shock
p277_264 Our objective is to tackle poverty
p277_265 It's a way of life
p277_266 The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline
p277_267 It was very fast
p277_268 The record companies have gone through the floor
p277_269 He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention
p277_270 In fact, he was talking about the survival business
p277_271 If not, he should go home
p277_272 It is not a process which can be completed overnight
p277_273 He looked very sharp
p277_274 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p277_275 All options are open
p277_276 Dialogue is the key
p277_277 They have shown a great desire and attitude
p277_278 It was a virus
p277_279 Maloney is an engaging talent
p277_280 The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together
p277_281 This is a national crisis
p277_282 It was good
p277_283 Who did the recruiting?
p277_284 Bombing slaughter rejected
p277_285 The songs are just so good
p277_286 The goals will come
p277_287 There's a pause
p277_288 That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients
p277_289 I was the sheep
p277_290 What has altered?
p277_291 I was brought up in a mining background
p277_292 Nothing is safe
p277_293 It would still have been a good film, but very different
p277_294 One was a lawyer
p277_295 The most important thing is to get a programme for government
p277_296 They are wrong
p277_297 Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school
p277_298 The plot is minimal
p277_299 You are the glory
p277_300 However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart
p277_301 The letters are going out today
p277_302 We want to play at the worlds
p277_303 He is also keen to win the European order of merit
p277_304 My whole life has changed
p277_305 We are a peaceful people
p277_306 You may have a short memory
p277_307 It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register
p277_308 My body is clearly capable
p277_309 Plans to celebrate the Queen's Golden Jubilee will proceed
p277_310 It is a private matter between the firm and our staff
p277_311 A review is under way
p277_312 It will work
p277_313 I came into this world with nothing
p277_314 It's too horrible to think
p277_315 We think all other measures are not exhausted
p277_316 Off with their heads
p277_317 Is there a new way forward?
p277_318 I was invited to work in Germany
p277_319 Is that an issue?
p277_320 Later in the day he was forced to explain his position
p277_321 You have to be able to deal with all age groups
p277_322 The same things will happen with GM foods
p277_323 I would be quite happy for the money to be given back
p277_324 It sounded as if it might well be tragic
p277_325 Well, it won't
p277_326 These days are long gone
p277_327 Two people were interviewed
p277_328 I've got no secret
p277_329 The package was expected to be launched within the next three months
p277_330 We lost our composure towards the interval, he said
p277_331 In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre
p277_332 Yet, for my money, he was not the man of the match
p277_333 A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference
p277_334 This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required
p277_335 He loves the big occasions
p277_336 The performance was excellent
p277_337 That has been lost
p277_338 Tell us about it
p277_339 He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal
p277_340 She said they would appeal
p277_341 A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company
p277_342 Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday
p277_343 Both of those promises have already been honoured
p277_344 In addition, it was in breach of natural justice
p277_346 As, indeed, they would be
p277_347 It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage
p277_348 To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential
p277_349 We will be homeless
p277_350 Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported
p277_351 Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment
p277_352 Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games
p277_353 There was a substantial explosion
p277_354 Not so, it seems
p277_355 He could make it
p277_356 Four policemen were wounded
p277_357 We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy
p277_358 It's now down in black and white
p277_359 Now, though, he has an incentive
p277_360 Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again
p277_361 They have not done so this season so far
p277_362 This big issue is whether it can be enforced
p277_363 It took about an hour for the gas to clear
p277_364 So there, we won
p277_365 By that time, however, it was already too late
p277_366 There is no signature
p277_367 It was a funny game
p277_368 He was the architect
p277_369 I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters
p277_370 I've never seen a game like it
p277_371 I am a wealthy person
p277_372 Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter
p277_373 He's delighted, too, with the new premises
p277_374 The Cabinet is split over the issue
p277_375 Something is wrong
p277_376 You can cope with it
p277_377 I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday
p277_378 That's the name of the game, though
p277_379 Since then, he has played no active part in the company
p277_380 Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director
p277_381 Family liaison officers are now working to support the family
p277_382 At the last I found a bunker
p277_383 Yet the data is compelling
p277_384 One day, he threw the baby against a wall
p277_385 It's a real problem
p277_386 On the contrary, it was actually very funny
p277_387 I was in the train station overnight
p277_388 It is unusual
p277_389 The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia
p277_390 It's like a basketball
p277_391 Well, it did last time, he was reminded
p277_392 I love the thought of having a crack at defending the title
p277_393 The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position
p277_394 It was a kind of contempt
p277_395 It was a breathtaking moment
p277_396 The car was just there
p277_397 It will take place in July
p277_398 The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today
p277_399 Is that possible?
p277_400 But, in fact, the reverse is true
p277_401 What was the difference between them?
p277_402 Emotions were complex
p277_403 Then , he laughs
p277_404 Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter
p277_405 It is an absolute nonsense
p277_406 They recorded their debut album in New York
p277_407 However, the players should have a voice in these matters
p277_408 He has written to the minister after meetings on the island
p277_409 But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition
p277_410 Feel the air, the space
p277_411 He got his degree
p277_412 I reminded myself that we were not talking about a death
p277_413 went on sale
p277_414 But we finished the show
p277_415 Mentally, you have to be tough
p277_416 The people around me were fantastic
p277_417 I wanted to help the poor people in Edinburgh
p277_418 It is legally binding
p277_419 Is there any prospect of this happening?
p277_420 There's been a mistake
p277_421 We just got a phone call on Saturday night
p277_422 Eriksson would have approved
p277_423 I am extremely cautious
p277_424 It was little else
p277_425 It all began as an accident
p277_426 The MoD has denied any cover-up
p277_427 I know the worry over Iraq
p277_428 It was a lot of hard work, but it wasn't difficult
p277_429 Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline
p277_430 The document argues that culture is at the heart of Scottish society
p277_431 We are all equal
p277_432 It's been a long, long journey
p277_433 We were used
p277_434 Last year, it was won by Jack McConnell, the first minister
p277_435 However, he held out little hope that the Government would take action
p277_436 They were not even allowed to see them
p277_437 That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano
p277_438 Horses are drawn by ballot
p277_439 It won the match
p277_440 And it showed
p277_441 The shift in public perception about the disease is amazing
p277_442 I hate the word
p277_443 Who would be in that desert?
p277_444 I was lost
p277_445 The children are fine
p277_446 They have to come up with a solution
p277_447 That was the first time I worked with Richard
p277_448 The whole region is in shock
p277_449 When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson
p277_450 It was a total disaster
p277_451 There will be no repeat of that performance, that I can guarantee
p277_452 I got a yellow card
p277_453 Stewart was the life and soul of the party
p277_454 Scotland has a dismal record of teenage pregnancy rates
p277_455 We're hopefully going to act as a catalyst for that
p277_456 If they don't, they should say so
p277_457 It is a vicious circle
p277_458 Scottish public finances emerge from this review enhanced
p277_459 She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers
p277_460 I'd love to be like Peter
p277_461 I am greatly relieved that the trust has reached its target
p277_462 From our point of view, the player is free to leave
p277_463 The consultants report commissioned by the previous Government was not published
p278_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p278_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p278_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p278_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p278_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p278_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p278_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p278_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p278_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p278_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p278_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p278_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p278_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p278_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p278_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p278_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p278_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p278_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p278_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p278_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p278_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p278_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p278_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p278_025 A shortlist is to be drawn up next month
p278_026 These decisions are not simple
p278_027 Life was like a timetable
p278_028 She is employed on short-term contracts
p278_029 They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life
p278_030 The director will be present
p278_031 Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons
p278_032 If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it
p278_033 It carried a double message
p278_034 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p278_035 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p278_036 Several investments have already been made
p278_037 It was a hell of a way to lose
p278_038 Among them are many criminals
p278_039 The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood
p278_040 This will get their attention
p278_041 Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight
p278_042 Well, the climate has changed
p278_043 Must be prepared to use it
p278_044 He looks like an Afghan
p278_045 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p278_046 How are you, sir ?
p278_047 So is that it, then ?
p278_048 Do I have a favourite ?
p278_049 He will need that machine
p278_050 I have learned from him
p278_051 I had trouble with the producers
p278_052 He also presented You Bet!
p278_053 People come to see the Highlands
p278_054 They are to ensure information reaches as many members as possible
p278_055 We have not given up hope
p278_056 She said she was really sorry
p278_057 None has ever been found
p278_058 Let's hope that it does
p278_059 The baby was later transferred to a hospital in Glasgow
p278_060 It was exactly four months away
p278_061 Charles Kennedy had an effective outing
p278_062 Only water is currently allowed
p278_063 I'm looking to the future
p278_064 But it has been an amazing experience
p278_065 The judge was really nice
p278_066 The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister
p278_067 The fans would love it
p278_068 Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator
p278_069 The party is up for it
p278_070 Even the one she loved
p278_071 It was a unanimous decision
p278_072 It's all going to clear the debt
p278_073 This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst
p278_074 Last week, he was taken into hospital
p278_075 Petrol prices were widely blamed
p278_076 By then, he was walking on water
p278_077 We have to offer value for money
p278_078 It's so hard to shift
p278_079 Mr Smith declined to comment
p278_080 Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll
p278_081 That was a great performance by the team
p278_082 He said a change in legislation was long overdue
p278_083 The allegations were still under investigation, he added
p278_084 Everyone had to play the game
p278_085 It was worth a photograph
p278_086 It was clear on Thursday
p278_087 It's not a holiday time for football players
p278_088 But they must believe in themselves
p278_089 We haven't finished the complaints procedure
p278_090 However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full
p278_091 Thomson is expected to manage the business
p278_092 The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened
p278_093 It was some time before she found out he was safe
p278_094 In the end we made too many errors
p278_095 That time is not now, however
p278_096 We created so many chances
p278_097 Our house was very small
p278_098 Why do it otherwise ?
p278_099 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p278_100 So, did she meet him ?
p278_101 So what is the campaign about ?
p278_102 And does it ?
p278_103 Are you from the rugby ?
p278_104 Had I heard ?
p278_105 Athletics is on a roll in the country
p278_106 We needed financial backing to get it off the ground
p278_107 I was just appalled at the way they behaved
p278_108 We have got a race
p278_109 The music industry hasn't changed at all
p278_110 Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National
p278_111 He was jailed for a year
p278_112 They almost achieved a draw
p278_113 Football is a passion for many
p278_114 I didn't think so either
p278_115 It was located on the remote control
p278_116 Maybe this battle has been
p278_117 That might help a bit
p278_118 This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service
p278_119 Ferguson will be a millionaire
p278_120 You can spend money on housing
p278_121 The hearing was due to continue today
p278_122 There will be no shortage of quality applicants
p278_123 However, the problem is the timing
p278_124 This is a frightening development
p278_125 Which can happen any time
p278_126 It was not a finale he would want to remember
p278_127 We had another last Tuesday
p278_128 I didn't feel under any pressure
p278_129 This should begin in October
p278_130 That first victory made a huge difference to my career
p278_131 The abuse of elderly people was appalling
p278_132 Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland
p278_133 That would open the gates of hell
p278_134 You've got to be vigilant
p278_135 But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner
p278_136 The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office
p278_137 Before it was an ordeal
p278_138 It will affect their work
p278_139 I love the spectacle of cinema
p278_140 They could use a boost
p278_141 Frankly, it was worth the booking
p278_142 Anyone can do the sums
p278_143 Others are not so sure
p278_144 I have always loved the countryside
p278_145 It was his job to check
p278_146 I haven't made any definite decisions
p278_147 There's always the next century
p278_148 There's only one team in Ayrshire
p278_149 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p278_150 I prefer the clarity of the existing system
p278_151 Nothing was meant by it
p278_152 The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms
p278_153 Its loss was an economic catastrophe for the whole of Moray
p278_154 It was by the numbers
p278_155 I knew he was good
p278_156 We will turn the corner
p278_157 Donald Dewar was passionate about his politics
p278_158 These days are long gone
p278_159 Worry can have that effect on some citizens
p278_160 The strong performance is expected to continue
p278_161 The Internet is no substitute for customer service
p278_162 So was the first half
p278_163 It's never great to finish second
p278_164 You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues
p278_165 We have a budget in March
p278_166 He is keen to stay in public service
p278_167 As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead
p278_168 US is the only country to vote against resolution
p278_169 Further growth will be funded from cash flow
p278_170 On my day I can beat anyone
p278_171 We've made a couple of albums
p278_172 My life has been destroyed
p278_173 What happened in that game ?
p278_174 Are you going to win ?
p278_175 Was it the wife ?
p278_176 Why change it ?
p278_177 What do we want to do that for ?
p278_178 I always felt they played for me
p278_179 His team management was protective
p278_180 You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions
p278_181 First and foremost, the game is entirely different
p278_182 The outcome is now in our own hands
p278_183 I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal
p278_184 It is vital to clarify their role
p278_185 It appears that it was just a genuine mistake
p278_186 They are determined to make a meaningful contribution
p278_187 Says the Duke of York
p278_188 That's not fair to the supporters
p278_189 They need to look after themselves
p278_190 I've always been like that
p278_191 It could be done by experts and lawyers
p278_192 They were seriously after him
p278_193 But there's an upturn in the sector
p278_194 It shows the strength of the roots
p278_195 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p278_196 It caused a lot of upset
p278_197 However, this idea is never developed
p278_198 I had come back from London
p278_199 Last night was a key episode
p278_200 They are still very quiet
p278_201 I wanted to put myself on the line
p278_202 I came home by ambulance
p278_203 We've had an enjoyable adventure
p278_204 It comes from reflection or thinking
p278_205 Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon
p278_206 We could soon be in that same position!
p278_207 It was a horrible thing to happen
p278_208 The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday
p278_209 I am very realistic about these things
p278_210 I won't make an official complaint
p278_211 He is a good signing for Rangers
p278_212 Bombing is the easy option
p278_213 It seemed a moving and fitting tribute
p278_214 The move follows a review of the Singapore
p278_215 They make a selective perception process
p278_216 Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match
p278_217 This gives a financial incentive to switch
p278_218 They have known the hard times
p278_219 It was important to win the singles
p278_220 The only problem was the greens
p278_221 January is a bad time of year
p278_222 His injury was completely random
p278_223 Today we must not repeat that mistake
p278_224 Twaddle is a case in point
p278_225 I'm just a regular person
p278_226 My daughter is an adult
p278_227 Does the name matter ?
p278_228 how do you get it back ?
p278_229 What are you not good at ?
p278_230 I think, therefore I am ?
p278_231 Who was she ?
p278_232 It was finally agreed on Saturday
p278_233 IT S all change at Kilmarnock
p278_234 Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement
p278_235 The City welcomed the brighter outlook
p278_236 Women were mostly notable by their absence
p278_237 The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions
p278_238 I have spoken to the skipper
p278_239 So far, the problems have occurred in the US
p278_240 The statement contained no surprises
p278_241 A small number of new jobs will also be created
p278_242 This would include the GM food industry
p278_243 My wife and family are the support system
p278_244 They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house
p278_245 He does not much like the Liberal Democrats
p278_246 I need a publishing deal!
p278_247 It had so much to do with output
p278_248 A fatal accident inquiry will be held into the death
p278_249 The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high
p278_250 That will be a decision for BBC Scotland
p278_251 There were no reports of casualties
p278_252 After his birthday, Scott was very upset
p278_253 It might be sad, but it's a fact
p278_254 He also launched a new strategy for the agency
p278_255 They made such decisions in London
p278_256 It seems a waste of talents
p278_257 I was just getting over the time difference
p278_258 Defensive stocks attracted some interest
p278_259 You can feel at home in China
p278_260 We have no information on Iraq
p278_261 Persuaded to change his mind
p278_262 Paterson can afford to be generous
p278_263 Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed
p278_264 I'm pleased with some aspects of the performance
p278_265 No production contract is yet in sight
p278_266 Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland
p278_267 Messages have to be reinforced
p278_268 It is not enough to be first division champions
p278_269 We accept the new rules
p278_270 And they were being paid ?
p278_271 was everything done to save people ?
p278_272 What was the matter for concern ?
p278_273 Do I think about them often ?
p278_274 Is it in the right place ?
p278_275 Blair is very positive at European Councils
p278_276 They are interior designers and architects
p278_277 He was released after treatment
p278_278 I rejected the idea of a separate residence
p278_279 I'd never run for them
p278_280 It does not work that way in Scottish football
p278_281 Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes
p278_282 These figures are truly terrible
p278_283 The merger was welcomed by Tony Blair
p278_284 The stage was set for a showdown
p278_285 This could put pressure on UK inflation
p278_286 I'd like to report a murder
p278_287 They want to shut the Scottish Office
p278_288 It all started with a visiting rugby club
p278_289 Those overseas offices were great
p278_290 I understand the security issue
p278_291 Truth is the child of time
p278_292 It has become a way of life
p278_293 Similar measures are expected in England and Wales
p278_294 Both companies have had a rough ride in recent years
p278_295 It was never a free kick
p278_296 They failed to reach agreement yesterday
p278_297 This is a great opportunity for us
p278_298 Scottish rugby has given me everything
p278_299 You have to expect this type of thing
p278_300 However, he will have his work cut out defending his title
p278_301 So the Government will be damaged
p278_302 It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday
p278_303 Gerhard Schroeder was the victor
p278_304 John was there already in spirit
p278_305 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p278_306 I intended to look for another club on loan
p278_307 We feel very comfortable in this international environment
p278_308 He will address the nation this evening
p278_309 They have shown a great desire and attitude
p278_310 I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh
p278_311 Maloney is an engaging talent
p278_312 It's not covered by the insurance
p278_313 Mr Campbell received a phone call
p278_314 I will never change our policy on paying appearance money
p278_315 You have to see it like this
p278_316 You have asked for action
p278_317 Holland won by five wickets
p278_318 Clydesdale Bank declined to comment
p278_319 The answer was in space
p278_320 It's unlikely to be renewed
p278_321 I first met him last summer
p278_322 The songs are just so good
p278_323 The casting is as perfect
p278_324 Saturday's match was fairly straightforward
p278_325 Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear
p278_326 McNaughton was not so sure
p278_327 The dealer is on notice
p278_328 We believe the world has too many refugees already
p278_329 She had gone to the Catholic school
p278_330 The party lasted all night
p278_331 The whole matter is somewhat in the air
p278_332 Much the same thing happens in a young company
p278_333 They come to enjoy themselves
p278_334 That meant the search was unlawful
p278_335 And he goes with it
p278_336 That reflected a tumble in banking shares across the board
p278_337 We are on a four-year mission
p278_338 The letters are going out today
p278_339 We want to play at the worlds
p278_340 Do you think we are a top nation ?
p278_341 How independent is that ?
p278_342 What form did that take ?
p278_343 What are they for ?
p278_344 Is there a waiting list ?
p278_345 The advisers had some discussions, but no conclusion was reached
p278_346 The Premier League has been a huge success
p278_347 And he is immensely loyal
p278_348 It looks as though the issue, with The Scotsman is too sensitive
p278_349 Other musicians were found in retirement
p278_350 That is a trend which will be encouraged
p278_351 And it was this one
p278_352 Scottish Newcastle will report its interim figures tomorrow
p278_353 My view has now completely changed
p278_354 Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items
p278_355 He was at school in Devon
p278_356 Finally came the moment of truth
p278_357 This might seem like an outrageous assertion
p278_358 A crucial moment has arrived
p278_359 In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations
p278_360 Three years ago he would have been
p278_361 But we welcome this document
p278_362 It intends to do so on Wednesday
p278_363 His views are hardly surprising
p278_364 He expected a conclusion by next Thursday
p278_365 The Allies intend to maintain the average
p278_366 We put our bid in last night
p278_367 Their condition is described as satisfactory
p278_368 We're still the only ones in the High Street
p278_369 I was delighted to accept
p278_370 A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry
p278_371 Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance
p278_372 The selection will be made by the International Olympic Committee next year
p278_373 From our point of view, the player is free to leave
p278_374 Lord Macdonald has worked on this deal for three months
p278_375 He must have seen the movie
p278_376 The parents are not alone in their concerns about the proposals
p278_377 The major championships will always have a special place
p278_378 That is a break with tradition
p278_379 This decision is a farce
p278_380 Is it worth it ?
p278_381 Does it matter ?
p278_382 How do you take them away ?
p278_383 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p278_384 After the match, do you ?
p278_385 Scrutiny by the European Parliament is limited
p278_386 In due course the deal was done
p278_387 This remains the party's policy
p278_388 They will fight for everything
p278_389 Tomorrow will be a different game entirely
p278_390 The team hadn't been picked
p278_391 One-third of the places are already taken
p278_392 I always knew she was funny
p278_393 The marshall at the turn was great
p278_394 There isn't the seriousness of other businesses
p278_395 They have not got anyone
p278_396 The law would appear to be on our side
p278_397 It has happened for generations
p278_398 The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful
p278_399 The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account
p278_400 There's still no-one like him
p278_401 They know it'll be fantastic
p278_402 This big issue is whether it can be enforced
p278_403 Clark is back on top form
p278_404 I had a fortunate war
p278_405 We must improve our relations with government
p278_406 The Cabinet is split over the issue
p278_407 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p278_408 That is the ultimate revenge
p278_409 The next few months will tell
p278_410 A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire
p279_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p279_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p279_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p279_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p279_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p279_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p279_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p279_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p279_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p279_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p279_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p279_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p279_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p279_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p279_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p279_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p279_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p279_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p279_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p279_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p279_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p279_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p279_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p279_025 It's a relief that a decision has finally been made
p279_026 He said the matter had been neglected in the past
p279_027 The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic
p279_028 They should be so lucky
p279_029 Is this accurate?
p279_030 I am not interested in the money, it is the principle
p279_031 There's a story, too
p279_032 People love to see this stuff
p279_033 He took me on a tour of the wards
p279_034 Horses are drawn by ballot
p279_035 It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies
p279_036 They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life
p279_037 They're just different
p279_038 Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons
p279_039 Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare
p279_040 President Bush is at war
p279_041 She is believed to be in South Africa
p279_042 I was scared
p279_043 Dancing was her life
p279_044 It will come all right
p279_045 It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside
p279_046 We will push
p279_047 That period was a struggle
p279_048 It is urgent
p279_049 It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract
p279_050 The judge said
p279_051 Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison
p279_052 We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there
p279_053 It's a blessing
p279_054 But it might have done
p279_055 The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids
p279_056 As she explains
p279_057 Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight
p279_058 He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention
p279_059 Life is good
p279_060 We've got a lot of respect for the Lions
p279_061 Here's a clue
p279_062 He had no enemies
p279_063 Sadly, it can't
p279_064 We have not given up hope
p279_065 Gerhard Schroeder was the victor
p279_066 That's the truth
p279_067 They were too hard
p279_068 The problems are a result of that shortfall
p279_069 Art is extra
p279_070 They're appalled by that
p279_071 George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision
p279_072 Scotland had great assets
p279_073 He was popular
p279_074 Have a look at our accounts
p279_075 It is like a river running by my home
p279_076 The end result is precisely the same
p279_077 It seemed so personal
p279_078 Painful, but only because it's true
p279_079 He had been a singer
p279_080 I've been there
p279_081 They do not work for Glasgow City Council
p279_082 Both sides have been hit by injury
p279_083 She died in hospital two hours later
p279_084 Is there a new way forward?
p279_085 It works for us
p279_086 It is a time bomb
p279_087 This is the way things should be handled
p279_088 The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning
p279_089 It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats
p279_090 Florida is the pivotal state in the nation
p279_091 Lord Levy said he started life with nothing
p279_092 They lived for their children
p279_093 Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today
p279_094 Yet, it worked
p279_095 This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager
p279_096 It is an old family habit
p279_097 Until you hit the big games
p279_098 The peace process will be buried!
p279_099 The oil companies would be asked to contribute
p279_100 We have always maintained that we would never abandon Scottish football
p279_101 The selection process is still at a very early stage
p279_102 However, we have not come to any conclusions
p279_103 After that time, the market itself will set the prices
p279_104 I see no need for change
p279_105 That would be unlawful
p279_106 I didn't play well last year
p279_107 Before the game we went for a pint
p279_108 They will want to perform well
p279_109 For these people, the ruling is very welcome
p279_110 I don't have many friends
p279_111 O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place
p279_112 Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin
p279_113 I was angry
p279_114 This is a step backwards
p279_115 We have to look at everything before we make any final decision
p279_116 This film will be totally awesome
p279_117 My office is bare
p279_118 Does this mean
p279_119 They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed
p279_120 That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships
p279_121 Who would have?
p279_122 Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland
p279_123 We work on the same level
p279_124 You can spend money on housing
p279_125 I felt very strongly that England should have it
p279_126 Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership
p279_127 I'm so angry
p279_128 Child abuse is a dreadful thing
p279_129 Despite the result, it was still a great moment
p279_130 Some of the characters will not be played by humans
p279_131 Well, you can have a tree
p279_132 We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence
p279_133 Because it's a waste of time for both sides
p279_134 It will be too hot
p279_135 The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council
p279_136 I am now unemployed
p279_137 You've got to be vigilant
p279_138 It's perfectly feasible
p279_139 There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music
p279_140 This represents a tough game for us
p279_141 That brought a wonderful marriage of bass and soprano
p279_142 And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life
p279_143 We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football
p279_144 Is that Titanic?
p279_145 That could mean the difference between life and death in action
p279_146 It is like a football team
p279_147 I am just trying to do my job
p279_148 They did very well
p279_149 You know the type
p279_150 In each case they were a goal down
p279_151 The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough
p279_152 A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar
p279_153 It was the same at Twickenham
p279_154 We also enjoyed a lot of support
p279_155 He then asked if he could have her seat and she refused
p279_156 This latter point is hugely important
p279_157 I am very happy with life
p279_158 These days are long gone
p279_159 It is an attitude of mind
p279_160 But we have not heard a thing from Diego
p279_161 Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks
p279_162 As, indeed, they would be
p279_163 I have got a wife to feed
p279_164 We do not comment on the behaviour of our authors
p279_165 Tell it like it was?
p279_166 It is not too late to get on board
p279_167 It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful
p279_168 By then, however, both men were already in the US
p279_169 Holyrood is just a part of the jigsaw
p279_170 Nobody did in those days
p279_171 My life has been destroyed
p279_172 His team management was protective
p279_173 Is Saddam a threat?
p279_174 We wanted it left for a wee while
p279_175 But the petrol station does not get the benefit
p279_176 It is not either national standards or local control
p279_177 The clarity is vital
p279_178 The hotel was now for sale
p279_179 I drove the ball well
p279_180 That has been the easy part
p279_181 Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked
p279_182 No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death
p279_183 Government will intervene
p279_184 We knew nothing about it
p279_185 Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted
p279_186 It's a portrait of Glasgow, not the portrait
p279_187 It's a joke
p279_188 Does this matter?
p279_189 It just came into my head that day
p279_190 My main concern is that public health is not put at risk
p279_191 It was an odd affair, in many respects
p279_192 It is tough, but possible
p279_193 We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome
p279_194 The procedure is the same in all cases
p279_195 Neither side would reveal the details of the offer
p279_196 The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date
p279_197 It was typical
p279_198 Our strategy is straightforward
p279_199 There would appear to be no motive for the attack
p279_200 I have a cold
p279_201 Tommy is not a problem
p279_202 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p279_203 The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday
p279_204 He had suffered a heart attack
p279_205 The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster
p279_206 I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling
p279_207 Some realism was needed about time, resources and management
p279_208 There was no rescue
p279_209 We're not seeing an image of the person, he said
p279_210 I don't want to use it
p279_211 This gives a financial incentive to switch
p279_212 The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn
p279_213 The road was closed for several hours
p279_214 That is an important part of our role
p279_215 Twaddle is a case in point
p279_216 I am delighted for Simon
p279_217 By hard work, is the answer
p279_218 I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery
p279_219 However, Dundee deserved to win this game
p279_220 His death was a tragic accident
p279_221 He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda
p279_222 He's a nice guy
p279_223 But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition
p279_224 A career as a doctor is on hold
p279_225 I am immensely sad
p279_226 I'd never seen a play about me
p279_227 It is a gamble
p279_228 My neighbours are horrified
p279_229 At the time, he was a living legend
p279_230 Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern
p279_231 They are the innocent victims
p279_232 Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final
p279_233 Broke the birdie record
p279_234 Police later said the scheme would end in November
p279_235 It is set in Paris
p279_236 They should come forward
p279_237 It is not an option, but a policy requirement
p279_238 Sadly, it sounds as if it is
p279_239 You take a risk
p279_240 It's too much work
p279_241 The court was shown a video of the house on that day
p279_242 It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet
p279_243 He will go a long way
p279_244 We did not compete with any other local farmer
p279_245 The scene is about this?
p279_246 It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak
p279_247 We will need to study the report before any decision is taken
p279_248 He's a lovely young man
p279_249 There will be widespread support on all sides
p279_250 This year I understood
p279_251 This is the culture change in medicine
p279_252 He said he intended to push for a judicial review
p279_253 He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather
p279_254 For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique
p279_255 It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit
p279_256 That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective
p279_257 This is a big club
p279_258 Blair is very positive at European Councils
p279_259 they fail to engage
p279_260 People should not become complacent
p279_261 The work between the musicians and the fire is very important
p279_262 The warning is timely
p279_263 Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention
p279_264 Blood samples were taken
p279_265 It looks as though he will be right
p279_266 Perhaps it's because I haven't finished the first two races
p279_267 I am totally horrified by the sentence
p279_268 It's very nice
p279_269 It left me with a sadness
p279_270 It was an easy decision to come here
p279_271 It is the same in Sweden
p279_272 That could be in place by next year
p279_273 Things can change
p279_274 A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes
p279_275 The script was funny
p279_276 They seem to get away with it
p279_277 She looked so young
p279_278 It happens from time to time
p279_279 For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray
p279_280 They expect the minister to ensure that commitment is honoured
p279_281 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p279_282 I intended to look for another club on loan
p279_283 You've got to have both sides
p279_284 The attacker died in the crash
p279_285 It was a virus
p279_286 Maloney is an engaging talent
p279_287 Who will perform?
p279_288 It's like a high school play
p279_289 It was hopeless
p279_290 I asked for a positive response and I was given one
p279_291 She said she could not believe that they had run away
p279_292 He wrote the letter two days before he died
p279_293 It changed my life
p279_294 These figures are truly awful
p279_295 He should have won
p279_296 Sunday's game was not a trial
p279_297 Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen
p279_298 What has altered?
p279_299 Graeme was prepared
p279_300 I thought it was my only chance
p279_301 One was a lawyer
p279_302 The most important thing is to get a programme for government
p279_303 They are wrong
p279_304 This is a war over our home
p279_305 In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge
p279_306 Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well
p279_307 It was entirely justified
p279_308 They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house
p279_309 It's certainly different
p279_310 The letters are going out today
p279_311 I did not name it
p279_312 The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him
p279_313 Special measures were needed
p279_314 It is all credit to them today
p279_315 They were fantastic
p279_316 Craig is a major concern for us
p279_317 My body is clearly capable
p279_318 I came into this world with nothing
p279_319 The airport was even different
p279_320 Hopefully, he will get a lucky break
p279_321 But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament
p279_322 He got the same story
p279_323 They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden
p279_324 He was then replaced by Ross
p279_325 She did not attend the courtroom
p279_326 You have to be able to deal with all age groups
p279_327 In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times
p279_328 Was this element always there?
p279_329 They haven't got a hope
p279_330 He did a good job
p279_331 I'm so pleased the show has won a prize
p279_332 It is so unfair
p279_333 It will be very, very tight
p279_334 That is the very reason why it was so vital
p279_335 In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre
p279_336 The composer will conduct
p279_337 It's always nice to play on Centre Court
p279_338 Alex Ferguson is the same
p279_339 The boat was fantastic
p279_340 I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil
p279_341 Like his acting, it was an accident
p279_342 A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry
p279_343 You need a licence to run a pub
p279_344 The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police
p279_345 The salary changes are long overdue
p279_346 The decision is an absolute disgrace
p279_347 It is horrible
p279_348 The pressure is on Celtic in the main
p279_349 I kept going for her
p279_350 He has seen the past
p279_351 Hartley should know
p279_352 We are looking for perfection
p279_353 It's not pretty, but it's effective
p279_354 It's that sort of night
p279_355 He could make it
p279_356 Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world
p279_357 I lost my head
p279_358 For one veteran, the memories remain vivid
p279_359 It was a double tragedy for the family
p279_360 He put some colour into Scottish history
p279_361 Well, the big day has arrived
p279_362 So there, we won
p279_363 By that time, however, it was already too late
p279_364 Breaking new ground is also very rewarding
p279_365 There is no signature
p279_366 Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter
p279_367 There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging
p279_368 He's delighted, too, with the new premises
p279_369 He has the edge
p279_370 Again, we were lucky
p279_371 He denied the charge
p279_372 Stevenson was arrested on Monday morning
p279_373 It has been a lovely family occasion
p279_374 That's the name of the game, though
p279_375 YOU thought it was a headache
p279_376 Family liaison officers are now working to support the family
p279_377 We have to reduce the number of plastic bags
p279_378 It doesn't always work that way
p279_379 I'm pleased about one thing
p279_380 We try to keep it right
p279_381 The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia
p279_382 It's like a basketball
p279_383 Stewart will travel with some confidence
p279_384 I can lead by example
p279_385 He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response
p279_386 He is on the wrong side
p279_387 It will probably take me just days to spend it
p279_388 I was in jail for five years
p279_389 It will take place in July
p279_390 However, BBC Scotland was not interested in his work
p279_391 The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions
p279_392 I never won a penny throughout my career
p279_393 His remarks appear to have had an effect
p279_394 He's already made history
p279_395 So I did
p279_396 You ask the question
p279_397 Not because they want to sing about something
p279_398 You make the choice
p279_399 I have been in good form for the last two years
p279_400 A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September
p279_401 Nobody even knew it had happened
p279_402 What would be the point?
p279_403 The weekly average was three hours
p279_404 Quality Meat Scotland was vigorous in its defence of the labelling
p279_405 The visual arts committee took this decision in December
p279_406 Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra
p282_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p282_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p282_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p282_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p282_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p282_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p282_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p282_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p282_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p282_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p282_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p282_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p282_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p282_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p282_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p282_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p282_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p282_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p282_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p282_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p282_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p282_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p282_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p282_025 But it failed
p282_026 Police were called to the scene, according to the weekend reports
p282_027 Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format
p282_028 However, the following year the cancer returned
p282_029 Their courage, and their honesty, should be respected
p282_030 This is the window
p282_031 He was jailed for five years
p282_032 Help is needed
p282_033 Then, suddenly, they weren't
p282_034 It is marvellous
p282_035 Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night
p282_036 However, they continued in their pursuit of victory
p282_037 They're just different
p282_038 It was clear
p282_039 Indeed, he does
p282_040 People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background
p282_041 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p282_042 Dancing was her life
p282_043 The ambition this year is to improve on last
p282_044 It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned
p282_045 They want to be entertained
p282_046 It's the only thing
p282_047 You had better believe it
p282_048 Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion
p282_049 On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options
p282_050 A neighbour said
p282_051 It is bizarre
p282_052 There is no reason at all
p282_053 In essence, the teaching profession has a choice
p282_054 Every aspect of our play was first class
p282_055 Our people are ready
p282_056 Here's a clue
p282_057 I was lost
p282_058 For the meantime, though, the signs are good
p282_059 My fitness was very poor
p282_060 Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident
p282_061 It is unique
p282_062 I expect a rapid response
p282_063 It happened so quickly
p282_064 That's the truth
p282_065 It seems to have worked
p282_066 This is the first step
p282_067 And if he hadn't become a musician?
p282_068 There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music
p282_069 I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset
p282_070 But I've won both ways
p282_071 Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p282_072 Robin Williams is very subdued
p282_073 They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide
p282_074 It could take some time
p282_075 We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy
p282_076 I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier
p282_077 It is a job creation scheme
p282_078 The party is up for it
p282_079 People must remain vigilant
p282_080 Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits
p282_081 What has changed?
p282_082 I will miss him
p282_083 He is in the queue
p282_084 I first met him last summer
p282_085 What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p282_086 Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games
p282_087 It just shows the arrogance of Labour and the Liberal Democrats
p282_088 They lived for their children
p282_089 The city council is a major property owner in the area
p282_090 Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today
p282_091 Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile
p282_092 We are on the path of change
p282_093 This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit
p282_094 Mr Livingstone described the decision as very damaging for the party
p282_095 Yet, it worked
p282_096 He's been hit by it
p282_097 I love the Dome
p282_098 I wish I had put on a brighter tie
p282_099 However, we have not come to any conclusions
p282_100 It is a love affair
p282_101 Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe
p282_102 They make a selective perception process
p282_103 Two of the team became ill
p282_104 That would be unlawful
p282_105 I don't want to use it
p282_106 Oil embargo endorsed
p282_107 It was an adventure
p282_108 Health Secretary Frank Dobson made the surprise announcement in the Commons yesterday
p282_109 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p282_110 According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland
p282_111 I was fighting for my life, I thought
p282_112 Is that right?
p282_113 He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter
p282_114 It's a shame
p282_115 It was the eighties
p282_116 It is so sad
p282_117 Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin
p282_118 The mood is upbeat
p282_119 It is rubbish
p282_120 Who would be a referee?
p282_121 That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships
p282_122 We enjoyed it today
p282_123 His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years
p282_124 Here, again, they were denied a voice
p282_125 There were no grounds for his action
p282_126 I'm so angry
p282_127 She really suffered for her art
p282_128 It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation
p282_129 It is not a U-turn
p282_130 No production was achieved
p282_131 I am now unemployed
p282_132 We had a great time when we came with Easy Rider
p282_133 It plans to return to this field
p282_134 We work well together
p282_135 The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday
p282_136 We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties
p282_137 Failure to comply with the order is likely to result in prison
p282_138 I was dead
p282_139 I don't know the full story
p282_140 Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray
p282_141 She died at her home
p282_142 He realises his mistake
p282_143 He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative
p282_144 Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition
p282_145 I was awful
p282_146 Who would have?
p282_147 He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context
p282_148 It is not just about pay
p282_149 It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment
p282_150 There was a substantial explosion
p282_151 I was stunned
p282_152 The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight
p282_153 The weather forecast isn't good
p282_154 They have not been named
p282_155 She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers
p282_156 My Dad is a hero
p282_157 For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon
p282_158 Words were not required
p282_159 The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids
p282_160 Life becomes a song
p282_161 Well, he should know
p282_162 Was this element always there?
p282_163 These days are long gone
p282_164 I'd love to be like Peter
p282_165 I've put my own money into this project
p282_166 It has to be now
p282_167 Military action is the only option we have on the table today
p282_168 I was in the train station overnight
p282_169 We have a budget in March
p282_170 We should do everything at a stroke
p282_171 You had to go and see him
p282_172 It's too early to say whether a public inquiry would be appropriate
p282_173 In a way he was
p282_174 They might be broken, but they are not defeated
p282_175 Blair's response was weak
p282_176 As we worked
p282_177 We are the gateway to justice
p282_178 I have the first six months of next season to prove myself
p282_179 The goals were good
p282_180 Within months, he was a part-time tribunal chairman
p282_181 It's an idea
p282_182 It wasn't a penalty, it was outside the area
p282_183 They need to look after themselves
p282_184 I saw military vehicles in the distance
p282_185 Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general
p282_186 Does this matter?
p282_187 Our team is just so young
p282_188 Suddenly, the rugby world had changed
p282_189 However, he had not yet been charged in connection with the robbery
p282_190 It caused a lot of upset
p282_191 But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections
p282_192 We speak about the performance
p282_193 It is a farce
p282_194 Peace was won
p282_195 It's a fact
p282_196 I came home by ambulance
p282_197 It is not satisfied with the standard of fire safety provisions
p282_198 Is that success?
p282_199 I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February
p282_200 Who will pay for this?
p282_201 It's all about money, money, money
p282_202 Sadly, it can't
p282_203 It was worth a photograph
p282_204 After that time, the market itself will set the prices
p282_205 We have an election in eight days
p282_206 Feel the heat?
p282_207 The proposals are to be debated on Monday by city councillors
p282_208 Twaddle is a case in point
p282_209 It had all been arranged
p282_210 IT S all change at Kilmarnock
p282_211 Work has started
p282_212 The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers
p282_213 On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football
p282_214 The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument
p282_215 Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E
p282_216 This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers
p282_217 Then another one came
p282_218 The loss of a company to the industry is a blow
p282_219 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p282_220 Clearly, the stakes are high
p282_221 It's a question of creating a future awareness
p282_222 I'd never seen a play about me
p282_223 It's not before time
p282_224 I didn't play too well in the third quarter
p282_225 I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision
p282_226 I would like to focus on a structure and a target
p282_227 Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern
p282_228 My wife and family are the support system
p282_229 Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable
p282_230 Dewar is certainly under attack from within his own party
p282_231 We are so proud
p282_232 The role was a knockout, but really difficult
p282_233 Of course I was tempted
p282_234 It's quite a line-up!
p282_235 On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence
p282_236 The minister is the engineer
p282_237 I was ready to shoot the day I read the screenplay
p282_238 It is hard won
p282_239 Our policy is clear
p282_240 I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday
p282_241 The scene is about this?
p282_242 In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify
p282_243 My son was too young to die
p282_244 In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win
p282_245 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p282_246 It was a hit
p282_247 Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults
p282_248 That could be in place by next year
p282_249 For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique
p282_250 It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit
p282_251 That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective
p282_252 they fail to engage
p282_253 It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland
p282_254 One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning
p282_255 They must play for each other
p282_256 However, the force has not yet received a formal complaint
p282_257 There's not much money in cycling
p282_258 This court has made an order which has not been observed
p282_259 George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks
p282_260 That review will look at management across the sector as a whole
p282_261 He has not created a Festival resource
p282_262 He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant
p282_263 He was also married with two children
p282_264 It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players
p282_265 Charles Kennedy had an effective outing
p282_266 Our objective is to tackle poverty
p282_267 One knows the feeling
p282_268 Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry
p282_269 The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline
p282_270 She has fallen in love with Scotland, however
p282_271 She failed in her action
p282_272 He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry
p282_273 She looked so young
p282_274 In fact, he was talking about the survival business
p282_275 It's so awful
p282_276 Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that
p282_277 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p282_278 You've got to have both sides
p282_279 Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished
p282_280 Dialogue is the key
p282_281 They have shown a great desire and attitude
p282_282 She is an expert on medical ethics
p282_283 Who will perform?
p282_284 This is a national crisis
p282_285 Who did the recruiting?
p282_286 She is really magic
p282_287 That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients
p282_288 I was the sheep
p282_289 I was brought up in a mining background
p282_290 In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat
p282_291 Nothing is safe
p282_292 But it's a subtle process
p282_293 One was a lawyer
p282_294 The most important thing is to get a programme for government
p282_295 A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election
p282_296 They are wrong
p282_297 Eight new hospitals are set to be built
p282_298 There were no passengers on board
p282_299 It could work
p282_300 This is a war over our home
p282_301 Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well
p282_302 There's no evidence he was ever there
p282_303 You should be
p282_304 However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart
p282_305 The letters are going out today
p282_306 Is there on his hands?
p282_307 The Premier League has been a huge success
p282_308 Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision
p282_309 She is very distinctive
p282_310 We have got to get the points from this one
p282_311 You may have a short memory
p282_312 Henman has been warned
p282_313 We are in the end game
p282_314 It will work
p282_315 I came into this world with nothing
p282_316 They will certainly be visible from every house in our area
p282_317 Our message was inclusive
p282_318 But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament
p282_319 Feel the air, the space
p282_320 Is there a new way forward?
p282_321 We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence
p282_322 The figures are bad, but not that bad
p282_323 Later in the day he was forced to explain his position
p282_324 However, they will only be found in the wild
p282_325 The same things will happen with GM foods
p282_326 Three years ago he would have been
p282_327 That's not eviction because he is not a tenant
p282_328 Locally, too, the MP is under fire
p282_329 Two people were interviewed
p282_330 I've got no secret
p282_331 We lost our composure towards the interval, he said
p282_332 This is a friendly match?
p282_333 A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference
p282_334 This is a sector in overall deficit and urgent action is required
p282_335 They should take their mobile phones
p282_336 He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal
p282_337 A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company
p282_338 Another case of foot-and-mouth disease was confirmed in Scotland yesterday
p282_339 She is free
p282_340 Both of those promises have already been honoured
p282_341 Tyson is overwhelmed
p282_342 In addition, it was in breach of natural justice
p282_343 Yet he left a few days later
p282_344 It was only a matter of time before someone was killed
p282_345 As, indeed, they would be
p282_346 It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage
p282_347 Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors
p282_348 To do so he reckons that a good opening result is essential
p282_349 The shareholders will vote to wind up the company on Friday morning
p282_350 That would help
p282_351 My husband was angry
p282_352 Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported
p282_353 And he laughs
p282_354 He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer
p282_355 This is a club on the rise
p282_356 It's not pretty, but it's effective
p282_357 Their time has gone
p282_358 He could make it
p282_359 The death rates are still as high
p282_360 Now, though, he has an incentive
p282_361 Anything is possible in football and we can beat Celtic again
p282_362 This big issue is whether it can be enforced
p282_363 It took about an hour for the gas to clear
p282_364 It is a simple equation
p282_365 By that time, however, it was already too late
p282_366 It was a funny game
p282_367 There wasn't a goal
p282_368 Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter
p282_369 Colour was at the core of his life
p282_370 He's delighted, too, with the new premises
p286_001 Please call Stella
p286_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p286_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p286_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p286_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p286_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p286_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p286_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p286_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p286_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p286_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p286_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p286_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p286_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p286_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p286_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p286_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p286_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p286_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p286_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p286_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p286_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p286_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p286_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p286_025 Smoking is also very important
p286_026 We must convince the citizens
p286_027 I am pretty careful with money
p286_028 Because we do not need it
p286_029 It is about control of our economy
p286_030 She has fallen in love with Scotland, however
p286_031 She is employed on short-term contracts
p286_032 They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life
p286_033 I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah
p286_034 Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons
p286_035 Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism
p286_036 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p286_037 Costs have got to be controlled
p286_038 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p286_039 The staff are as good as any staff in the city
p286_040 It is serious - but not that serious
p286_041 Among them are many criminals
p286_042 He looks like an Afghan
p286_043 He will need that machine
p286_044 Her body was found about four miles from the car
p286_045 I had come back from London
p286_046 Pulled a huge number of viewers
p286_047 I had trouble with the producers
p286_048 Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer
p286_049 We are certainly talking about many millions
p286_050 We are a new department
p286_051 He also presented You Bet!
p286_052 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p286_053 How are you, sir ?
p286_054 So is that it, then ?
p286_055 Do I have a favourite ?
p286_056 People come to see the Highlands
p286_057 The outcome of their game isn't the important thing
p286_058 We have not given up hope
p286_059 The cuts were made within an hour of each other
p286_060 We would have concerns about suspension
p286_061 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p286_062 We have to keep our clients
p286_063 It seems to have worked
p286_064 They have to come up with a solution
p286_065 Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London
p286_066 It is a great feeling right now
p286_067 It's not covered by the insurance
p286_068 Robin Williams is very subdued
p286_069 It wasn't possible to relax
p286_070 We speak about the performance
p286_071 Then followed a bout of flu
p286_072 Both sides have been hit by injury
p286_073 That would be too easy
p286_074 I want the Commonwealth and European titles
p286_075 It is a job creation scheme
p286_076 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p286_077 Even the one she loved
p286_078 Talk of a crisis is absurd
p286_079 Their mandate is to target inflation
p286_080 England were ahead until two minutes into injury time
p286_081 It's all going to clear the debt
p286_082 This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst
p286_083 Petrol prices were widely blamed
p286_084 He has been a success this year
p286_085 The error appeared in a warrant
p286_086 We have to offer value for money
p286_087 Florida is the pivotal state in the nation
p286_088 It's so hard to shift
p286_089 Potions said he would drive
p286_090 Theatre is not a museum
p286_091 Why do it otherwise ?
p286_092 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p286_093 So, did she meet him ?
p286_094 So what is the campaign about ?
p286_095 And does it ?
p286_096 Are you from the rugby ?
p286_097 Had I heard ?
p286_098 Last weekend was extremely frustrating
p286_099 Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll
p286_100 The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation
p286_101 It really was an unusual award
p286_102 I cannot believe this decision
p286_103 The allegations were still under investigation, he added
p286_104 Until you hit the big games
p286_105 The outsourcing deal will take effect in September
p286_106 We will deal with the refugees
p286_107 The oil companies would be asked to contribute
p286_108 We could not get any possession
p286_109 They must be on commission
p286_110 He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels
p286_111 It's not a holiday time for football players
p286_112 He was forced to quit
p286_113 But I know the course
p286_114 Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked
p286_115 We should recognise that others have done a good job
p286_116 In the end we made too many errors
p286_117 But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant
p286_118 We needed financial backing to get it off the ground
p286_119 Our offer represents an attractive price for the business
p286_120 The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest
p286_121 It is an impressive record
p286_122 I'm pleased to get through the opening match
p286_123 I have learned from him
p286_124 I will never change our policy on paying appearance money
p286_125 The situation is not easy, but we will prevail
p286_126 Maybe this battle has been
p286_127 In addition, investor choice is reduced
p286_128 It isn't a happy memory
p286_129 The firm also has a construction division
p286_130 Harry Potter has lost his magic
p286_131 Then again, we could have
p286_132 They will remember this victory for a while
p286_133 Structural changes were also required
p286_134 It was a good game to watch
p286_135 His job was not advertised
p286_136 However, the problem is the timing
p286_137 They keep the atmosphere in mind
p286_138 Which can happen any time
p286_139 It is the latter which has prompted the warning
p286_140 The abuse of elderly people was appalling
p286_141 My life has changed a lot
p286_142 He said to give a local injection
p286_143 The manager's position was obviously included in that review
p286_144 The first half was depressing
p286_145 Tiger is not the norm
p286_146 He will get his chances
p286_147 They could use a boost
p286_148 What happened in that game ?
p286_149 Are you going to win ?
p286_150 Was it the wife ?
p286_151 Why change it ?
p286_152 What do we want to do that for ?
p286_153 At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived
p286_154 Anyone can do the sums
p286_155 The striker needed attention before he could resume
p286_156 He's not a Celtic man

p286_438 Which may be the same thing
p286_439 Strangely enough I felt very sharp

p286_462 The peace process will be buried!
p286_463 We are now up against it
p286_464 Failure to react to each one could mean a disaster
p286_465 It is vital to clarify their role
p286_466 He was backed by Downing Street
p286_467 It also indicated that her condition had deteriorated
p286_468 You have to have a proven track record to get them
