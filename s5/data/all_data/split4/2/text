p236_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p236_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p236_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p236_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p236_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p236_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p236_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p236_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p236_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p236_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p236_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p236_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p236_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p236_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p236_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p236_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p236_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p236_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p236_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p236_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p236_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p236_025 A shortlist is to be drawn up next month
p236_026 In both cases, I suffered a fiasco
p236_027 Meetings will also remain private
p236_028 Because we do not need it
p236_029 It's going to have a hell of an effect
p236_030 And we have a singer
p236_031 He was jailed for four years
p236_032 He should emerge as the winner
p236_033 This is a central issue
p236_034 He works at the airport
p236_035 It is not for any other purpose
p236_036 If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it
p236_037 It carried a double message
p236_038 That means an extra two years
p236_039 That was the case with David
p236_040 The staff are as good as any staff in the city
p236_041 I needed a change, a new challenge
p236_042 Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man
p236_043 Their campaign is in disarray
p236_044 But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded
p236_045 We are working on it
p236_046 He looks like an Afghan
p236_047 Everything else is a bonus
p236_048 Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts
p236_049 This is the interesting part
p236_050 I haven't been ill at all
p236_051 They just thought it was extremely good acting
p236_052 That was the difference today
p236_053 We keep an eye on it
p236_054 The City welcomed the brighter outlook
p236_055 We felt it was sufficient
p236_056 You must have a government and a good civil service
p236_057 Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued
p236_058 You should consider whether you want to be in this film
p236_059 But retail banking would be run from Halifax
p236_060 I have proved that in the past
p236_061 The tournament has now been cancelled
p236_062 I was very pleased with them today, though
p236_063 I was as strong as a horse
p236_064 Then followed a bout of flu
p236_065 The talks were announced yesterday by Brian Wilson, the foreign office minister
p236_066 Both men were on one-year contracts
p236_068 Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator
p236_069 It is a job creation scheme
p236_070 He was seen as the enemy
p236_071 It looks like a hit
p236_072 These people are not big names
p236_073 This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst
p236_074 We did it for the jersey
p236_075 The Festival is prepared to help
p236_076 Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat
p236_077 By then, he was walking on water
p236_078 He was just a journalist
p236_079 On Saturday, it was much the same
p236_080 They lived for their children
p236_081 We have turned the corner
p236_083 The Queen Mother is dead
p236_084 However, the approach is not believed to be hostile
p236_085 Change will however have to be in euros
p236_086 It was a big departure
p236_087 Does it matter ?
p236_088 How do you take them away ?
p236_089 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p236_090 After the match, do you ?
p236_091 The oil companies would be asked to contribute
p236_092 The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen
p236_093 It is open season on the Old Firm
p236_094 The court was shown a video of the house on that day
p236_095 I had a ball today
p236_096 He refused to name the survivors
p236_097 That time is not now, however
p236_098 We created so many chances
p236_099 Before the game we went for a pint
p236_100 Our house was very small
p236_101 It will also require a lengthy series of clinical trials
p236_102 It became difficult for me
p236_103 It's not a lack of effort
p236_104 It is a total and utter change of culture
p236_105 He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter
p236_107 They will notice a difference
p236_108 Football is a passion for many
p236_109 New Year will be very busy
p236_110 There's still plenty time left
p236_111 The result is a vacuum
p236_112 I've heard this stuff about the markets
p236_113 You can spend money on housing
p236_114 The hearing was due to continue today
p236_115 I can't even get into the A team
p236_116 In addition, investor choice is reduced
p236_117 But his attendance is not guaranteed
p236_118 Three hours later, the man was free
p236_119 Which can happen any time
p236_120 The colours are very pretty
p236_121 He is a lovely man
p236_122 Becoming a father was wonderful
p236_123 I was on a roll
p236_124 The abuse of elderly people was appalling
p236_125 Something will be done by corporate bodies
p236_126 He said to give a local injection
p236_127 They made such decisions in London
p236_128 You are a gambling man
p236_129 Before it was an ordeal
p236_130 I love the spectacle of cinema
p236_131 We will try to find someone
p236_132 They could use a boost
p236_133 She died at her home
p236_134 I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood
p236_135 I enjoy the creative process
p236_136 But the main thing will be to avoid the bunkers
p236_137 Five minutes later, the home team were back in front
p236_138 It was a piece of art
p236_139 That view has not altered
p236_140 It's all change at Kilmarnock
p236_141 So I got a blood test
p236_142 It has become a way of life
p236_143 The whole industry is a shambles
p236_144 Like the others, he was arrested
p236_145 We will provide immediate access
p236_146 He could do nothing about it
p236_147 We have a clean bill of health
p236_148 Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment
p236_149 I was shaking on the blocks
p236_151 It was by the numbers
p236_152 It would seem a natural progression
p236_153 This year, this month, will be special for Torrance
p236_154 This action reflects a slump in bookings
p236_155 Being involved at that level is like an addiction
p236_156 It was a funny feeling
p236_157 I'm afraid to say anything
p236_158 We did what we had to do
p236_159 It's not like us
p236_161 It is not a financial issue
p236_162 I have got a wife to feed
p236_163 Seven people were later detained by police
p236_164 The striker needed attention before he could resume
p236_165 We have a budget in March
p236_166 He is not a team captain
p236_167 Greenwood said he was happy with that
p236_168 Overall, the labour market continued to tighten
p236_169 It opens the door to the Champions League
p236_170 That is not the case
p236_172 It's nice to be nice
p236_173 They could not match it
p236_174 Are they free ?
p236_175 What are they for ?
p236_176 Is there a waiting list ?
p236_177 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p236_178 So what happens next ?
p236_179 Had this been common practice ?
p236_180 What do they want us to do ?
p236_181 At that point, the structure of the board was changed
p236_182 One season, they might do well
p236_183 I feel like my game has come a long way
p236_184 The Hibs manager is no fool
p236_185 It is not either national standards or local control
p236_186 City sentiment is in his favour
p236_187 The hotel was now for sale
p236_188 We are the gateway to justice
p236_189 Tomorrow is a new day
p236_190 It makes no influence on the public
p236_191 Each case is treated on merit
p236_192 I have spoken to head office
p236_193 Says the Duke of York
p236_194 I had too much to drink
p236_195 As many as the market will support
p236_196 They need to look after themselves
p236_197 That is a waste of energy
p236_198 The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland
p236_199 It could be argued that the council was pushed to the brink
p236_200 I had a train to catch
p236_201 It shows the strength of the roots
p236_202 However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu
p236_203 This youngster is so exciting!
p236_204 We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome
p236_205 It caused a lot of upset
p236_206 Motorists will buy passes in advance
p236_207 My duty is to win
p236_208 Tony Blair's official spokesman said
p236_209 On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door
p236_210 No details of the talks were given
p236_211 This will be our new beginning
p236_212 They have the cash and the fire power
p236_213 The service from the other players was super
p236_214 The early physical reports were clear
p236_215 Tommy is not a problem
p236_216 The sanctions are about collective punishment
p236_217 John Daly has a burning ambition
p236_218 A deadline is still essential
p236_219 You have caught a serial killer
p236_220 You are a great player
p236_221 I won't make an official complaint
p236_222 It was worth a photograph
p236_223 They are looking at a flotation
p236_224 Which isn't a bad idea
p236_225 There is no quick fix
p236_226 There was a lot of resentment
p236_227 That might help a bit
p236_228 From there, they can go anywhere
p236_229 Death is outside the language
p236_230 I had relied on him
p236_231 The course has helped a lot
p236_232 I'm just a regular person
p236_233 It had all been arranged
p236_234 His third goal was superb
p236_235 Basically, they have to come up with the offer
p236_236 I am considered a teenager
p236_237 Anyway, the job will be part-time
p236_238 This will secure the future of our industry
p236_239 For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon
p236_240 People should make their own decisions
p236_241 They said that they stood by their statement
p236_242 You have to do your research
p236_243 We played them off the pitch
p236_244 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p236_245 Truth is the child of time
p236_246 And they were being paid ?
p236_247 Was everything done to save people ?
p236_249 Do I think about them often ?
p236_250 That wasn't an outstanding performance from Celtic
p236_251 A small number of new jobs will also be created
p236_252 It's important to get it right
p236_253 Pensions are a long-term investment
p236_254 Those overseas offices were great
p236_255 On Wednesday, it is the turn of Cable Wireless
p236_256 Half of young people had had contact with the police
p236_257 I was just a kid
p236_258 He was good, but not that good
p236_259 It was quite a new prescription
p236_260 It is very hard for her
p236_261 He also launched a new strategy for the agency
p236_262 It is believed the size of the settlement has not been finalised
p236_263 We lost our composure towards the interval, he said
p236_264 Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars
p236_265 You can feel at home in China
p236_266 Either way, the investor retains the premium
p236_267 The calls were last night rejected by the US and the UK
p236_268 Washington is consumed by the crisis
p236_269 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p236_270 But they were never expected to last
p236_271 However, he lasted only five days before going on the run
p236_272 The capital costs are modest
p236_273 I told you I was ill
p236_274 He will go on the bench
p236_275 That could be in place by next year
p236_276 We accept the new rules
p236_277 We run within the law
p236_278 We have the moral high ground
p236_279 He took over our lives
p236_280 It has all been done in secret
p236_281 They must play for each other
p236_282 Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis
p236_283 She always wanted her own way
p236_284 I realised I was lucky to have it
p236_285 They can leave at any time
p236_286 Much of the equipment was new
p236_287 Blair also had a penalty
p236_288 Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate
p236_289 Frankly, we should all have such problems
p236_290 It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment
p236_291 My body is a wreck
p236_292 She failed in her action
p236_293 Stephen will get his first cap
p236_294 The partnership was set up during the summer
p236_295 And that match was played in June
p236_296 I saw it at a ruck
p236_297 What do we want to do that for ?
p236_298 Does the name matter ?
p236_299 how do you get it back ?
p236_300 What are you not good at ?
p236_301 I think, therefore I am ?
p236_302 It's all designed to speed up the service
p236_303 Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished
p236_304 He will address the nation this evening
p236_305 They have shown a great desire and attitude
p236_306 Maloney is an engaging talent
p236_307 The rescue package is public money
p236_308 I was there five months ago
p236_309 I am a retailer by nature
p236_310 His job was not advertised
p236_311 We can work all night
p236_312 It was really very frightening
p236_313 It was an excellent performance
p236_314 The answer is with ourselves
p236_315 And we can do it
p236_316 These figures are truly awful
p236_317 That is the real test
p236_318 They have to be addressed
p236_319 It aims to produce its report before Christmas
p236_320 Cast Away now on general release
p236_321 All winners should be tested
p236_322 I can live with it
p236_323 A lot has been written
p236_324 And he goes with it
p236_325 The law will take its course
p236_326 This is a historic occasion
p236_327 This ruling is a farce
p236_328 After some discussion they did
p236_329 I am not obsessed with sex
p236_330 I didn't have the reply
p236_331 Public opinion was split on the proposal
p236_332 These days will be back
p236_333 You may have a short memory
p236_335 There was no time scale
p236_336 That decision has already been made
p236_337 In his absence, the council adopted the change
p236_338 The game is now open
p236_339 The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office
p236_340 Even the one she loved
p236_341 Finally, he paid for the movie
p236_342 It was almost too much
p236_343 Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side
p236_344 The idea was first mooted a year ago
p236_345 Three years ago he would have been
p236_346 It's a policy which has worked for us
p236_347 We think a lot of Allan McGregor
p236_348 The confidence isn't there now
p236_349 We put our bid in last night
p236_350 A great deal has been achieved
p236_351 He had no previous convictions
p236_352 Alex Ferguson is the same
p236_353 What do we do ?
p236_354 Why do it otherwise ?
p236_355 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p236_356 So, did she meet him ?
p236_357 George Mitchell is trying to close the gap
p236_358 Like his acting, it was an accident
p236_359 Scotland is the home of golf
p236_360 They have broken that promise
p236_361 From our point of view, the player is free to leave
p236_362 It's only a matter of scale
p236_363 We must put a marker down
p236_364 She said they would appeal
p236_365 There is no deal as yet
p236_366 It's as wide as a church in here
p236_367 The work with Alison was a great experience
p236_368 It was like a weekly wage
p236_369 We are a Scottish company
p236_370 They will fight for everything
p236_371 The pair are very much in love
p236_372 We used to keep our business rates
p236_373 Everything is now in place for Manchester
p236_374 It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage
p236_375 Everyone could see the joke
p236_376 All would be under threat
p236_377 I understand the frustration of the fans
p236_378 On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options
p236_379 The seller was not revealed
p236_380 People are on the alert
p236_381 I can confirm that Miss Deacon has received a threatening phone call
p236_382 We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy
p236_383 A review is under way
p236_384 They know it'll be fantastic
p236_385 This big issue is whether it can be enforced
p236_386 Clark is back on top form
p236_387 Motion described it as a unique event
p236_388 It brought in new management
p236_389 My view has now completely changed
p236_390 She is in their hands
p236_391 The following day I used the story
p236_392 However, the players should have a voice in these matters
p236_393 The Cabinet is split over the issue
p236_394 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p236_395 I should think so, too
p236_396 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p236_397 How are you, sir ?
p236_398 So is that it, then ?
p236_399 Do I have a favourite ?
p236_400 It certainly appeared that way
p236_401 I didn't know that I had a court appearance on Wednesday
p236_402 We can produce a blueprint for farmers to follow
p236_403 I will be able to say in a couple of weeks
p236_404 I remain a buyer of the shares
p236_405 But demand for space in Edinburgh is still strong
p236_406 It had been on the cards
p236_407 He seems to be used to the attention
p236_408 The trick is to try it
p236_409 I would love to think that she could win
p236_410 He may have a point
p236_411 The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position
p236_412 He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response
p236_413 He is on the wrong side
p236_414 My husband was born in Zimbabwe
p236_415 I've got my own ideas
p236_416 I never had a childhood
p236_417 Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt
p236_418 I think it's a miracle
p236_419 They were not complacent in any way
p236_420 They did the right thing
p236_421 He will be judged by his actions
p236_422 The fate of the rest is unknown
p236_423 It is an absolute nonsense
p236_424 Young families accounted for a growing share of the trade
p236_425 Sadly, the surface was a nightmare
p236_426 Everything in golf is a balance
p236_427 It is a case of pity for us
p236_428 I believe the gap is nearly there
p236_429 Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey
p236_430 We've got a good management record
p236_431 It was that bad, that low
p236_432 Paris is not only young
p236_433 However, the downturn has forced the overdraft request
p236_434 But you can go beyond that condition
p236_435 But we have built a platform for next season
p236_436 It looked like a war zone
p236_437 He said current trading was strong
p236_438 I chose to make a film
p236_439 I can tell you Labour is fighting to win
p236_440 But by that time, it was too late
p236_441 The damage is all inside
p236_442 Nine days later, he suffered another attack
p236_443 We would have concerns about that
p236_444 I know the worry over Iraq
p236_445 Taxes may need to rise
p236_446 Equally the employee could claim a public interest
p236_447 Phil Mickelson did that last year
p236_448 No options are excluded at all
p236_449 The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton
p236_450 We are going for it
p236_451 Miss Jackson was not present to put her case
p236_452 It is a cause for concern
p236_453 The weather in the area of the crash was severe
p236_454 I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal
p236_455 He deserved a red card
p236_456 They were not even allowed to see them
p236_457 And she is very clear on this
p236_458 And it covers the spectrum
p236_459 Dennis was not so sure
p236_460 The chief constable has retired
p236_461 It will determine whether an offence has occurred
p236_462 It is a crisis, without a doubt
p236_463 Not if you know the person
p236_464 Her body was found about four miles from the car
p236_465 I was all image and no substance
p236_466 The boys are mentally focused
p236_467 It can all be done over the phone
p236_468 The bill would be massive
p236_469 When people talk about the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson
p236_470 Neither woman has been named
p236_471 He was certainly upbeat about his chances
p236_472 We live by the rule of law
p236_473 They make a selective perception process
p236_474 He was a shooting star
p236_475 I could feel the blood on my face
p236_476 I am a committed European
p236_477 Analysts said the offer was fair
p236_478 These people attack the core of my beliefs
p236_479 Then came the farewell to Europe
p236_480 It is a vicious circle
p236_481 He will be advised by me
p236_482 Winning a medal is a dream
p236_483 We had to add value
p236_484 That is the bottom line
p236_485 It happens on an annual basis
p236_486 However, he emphasised the bank was satisfied with progress
p236_487 We have to go for a win
p236_488 It worked well in Monaco
p236_489 Something has got to change
p236_490 I had it before the final
p236_491 Our fans have been marvellous
p236_492 The BBC was a disgrace
p236_493 I would put my money on Peter Donald
p236_494 It was still there, but right at the end
p236_495 The Prime Minister has been in touch
p236_496 They never gave up hope
p236_497 He had planned to sell it
p236_498 I was ready for this
p236_499 In fact, we were all over the shop
p236_500 A Scotsman has to defend his castle
p236_501 Our idea is to share and lower the cost
p236_502 I stayed away from the defence
p236_503 Lord Sainsbury is not a newcomer
p239_001 Please call Stella
p239_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p239_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p239_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p239_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p239_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p239_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p239_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p239_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p239_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p239_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p239_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p239_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p239_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p239_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p239_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p239_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p239_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p239_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p239_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p239_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p239_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p239_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p239_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p239_025 They might have asked, for goodness sake
p239_026 The Government, however, insists the company is not for sale
p239_027 And so was a photograph
p239_028 We are not aware of any British casualties at this stage
p239_029 There isn't the seriousness of other businesses
p239_030 It is about control of our economy
p239_031 There was a rush of water
p239_032 That's all I was trying to do today
p239_033 Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy
p239_034 Drink and petrol prices remain untouched
p239_035 I might well have done so already
p239_036 That can cost him a fortune
p239_037 He works at the airport
p239_038 How do you take them away ?
p239_039 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p239_040 After the match, do you ?
p239_041 Has the conflict started ?
p239_042 Have I really come to this ?
p239_043 This matter has still to come before the European Parliament
p239_044 It carried a double message
p239_045 Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing
p239_046 But not a penny has been paid
p239_047 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p239_048 Alliance Leicester would give it a presence in southern England
p239_049 We must learn to finish
p239_050 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p239_051 New York is my home
p239_052 The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager
p239_053 I remember that day well
p239_054 Mexico City was a wonderful experience
p239_055 He is too weak to move
p239_056 Bill Clinton always had an idea to sell
p239_057 I feel we might now have the foundations to go forward
p239_058 Among them are many criminals
p239_059 That's been the difference between the sides
p239_060 And they removed a Borderer
p239_061 All manner of precaution and protection are taken
p239_062 Perhaps we should do the same
p239_063 Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight
p239_064 They were on holiday in Egypt
p239_065 They desperately want some stability
p239_066 Everything is possible in football
p239_067 Everyone could see the joke
p239_068 I'm pleased with the horse
p239_069 He will need that machine
p239_070 The new clubhouse was packed with people watching the game on TV
p239_071 Then they scored two goals to win
p239_072 In fact, it was Geoffrey Robinson
p239_073 Pulled a huge number of viewers
p239_074 The Labour Party's not downbeat, and neither is the Labour Government
p239_075 Let's not be too despondent
p239_076 The Government does not go far enough
p239_077 He phoned the number in the brochure
p239_078 I haven't got there yet
p239_079 I can understand the frustrations of our fans
p239_080 They hoped to remain in the Edinburgh area
p239_081 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p239_082 Labour has replaced the Tories as the party of the family
p239_083 But the organisers refused to worry
p239_084 And it had two seats
p239_085 Indeed, it is only the beginning
p239_086 Or so the theory goes
p239_087 He has really done well
p239_088 So what happens next ?
p239_089 Had this been common practice ?
p239_090 What do they want us to do ?
p239_091 Is it worth it ?
p239_092 Does it matter ?
p239_093 George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision
p239_094 But I had never been in a theatre
p239_095 It was fun, but not a living
p239_096 Kenny Miller might come through
p239_097 Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London
p239_098 The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account
p239_099 We will pay their bills
p239_100 Sales are falling after years of growth
p239_101 It was exactly four months away
p239_102 But they also noted a partial strengthening of survey evidence
p239_103 We have a major concern about enforcement action
p239_104 I am so proud of him
p239_105 This time, it might be for real
p239_106 He will be kept informed
p239_107 There could be a way back
p239_108 He was a lovely man
p239_109 People will have to be patient
p239_110 I can't remember a lot of it
p239_111 Instead, another depression came in
p239_112 Talk of a crisis is absurd
p239_113 We have thought about doing lots of things
p239_114 It is sometimes like that
p239_115 The partners are looking for answers
p239_116 I've had it for the exams
p239_117 Those people must be accountable
p239_118 We feel very comfortable in this international environment
p239_119 The Festival is prepared to help
p239_120 Accordingly, financial restructuring is required
p239_121 The error appeared in a warrant
p239_122 They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life
p239_123 Basically we lost the game because we were outplayed
p239_124 He was just a journalist
p239_125 They lived for their children
p239_126 Their season has been consigned to history
p239_127 Diversions were put in place
p239_128 How independent is that ?
p239_129 What form did that take ?
p239_130 Are they free ?
p239_131 What are they for ?
p239_132 Is there a waiting list ?
p239_133 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p239_134 Maybe he has been away from British football for too long
p239_135 Last weekend was extremely frustrating
p239_136 Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll
p239_137 Gary Parker is a favourite of mine
p239_138 The allegations were still under investigation, he added
p239_139 It is the only practical access for vehicles and men
p239_140 So it was at Easter Road
p239_141 A move to Manchester United would be tremendous
p239_142 Absences should be carefully monitored
p239_143 He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels
p239_144 The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible
p239_145 We just have to adapt
p239_146 He was forced to quit
p239_147 Gordon Marshall was outstanding against us
p239_148 People have been placed in a state of alarm
p239_149 I was given no instructions by no-one
p239_150 The move follows a review of the Singapore
p239_151 Which isn't a bad idea
p239_152 Since then, things have improved
p239_153 That's what happened against Ayr
p239_154 Hopefully, no-one will suffer too badly
p239_155 He removed the rubble with the help of passers-by
p239_156 It is a good lifestyle
p239_157 Before the game we went for a pint
p239_158 Our relationship has been very good
p239_159 It was the climax of the thing
p239_160 Nato has left them with no other option
p239_161 Scottish Enterprise and the banks have been very supportive
p239_162 I think the referee was good
p239_163 I understand the medical concerns
p239_164 Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National
p239_165 This was a unique election
p239_166 They exist in name alone
p239_167 We have reacted well to each other
p239_168 I can see it now
p239_169 Having guidelines in advance is helpful
p239_170 There's still plenty time left
p239_171 Those three weeks are totally lost
p239_172 This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service
p239_173 She is in good spirits
p239_174 As if that is an achievement
p239_175 Mr Blair should be warned
p239_176 Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month
p239_177 There was a fossil on screen
p239_178 Is it in the right place ?
p239_179 Did he trip ?
p239_180 Does that put pressure on us ?
p239_181 Did it work ?
p239_182 Do you think we are a top nation ?
p239_183 Here, again, they were denied a voice
p239_184 Structural changes were also required
p239_185 His job was not advertised
p239_186 That was just one night
p239_187 This is a frightening development
p239_188 They keep the atmosphere in mind
p239_189 Millions of British jobs depend on Europe
p239_190 Sloppy answers are to be avoided
p239_191 That is an entirely unacceptable position
p239_192 My father died in childbirth
p239_193 In addition, margins have been maintained
p239_194 Such an appointment could go some way to reassure investors
p239_195 The Yugoslav army will still be there
p239_196 Two years of building a business will go up in smoke
p239_197 You've got to be vigilant
p239_198 He said the director had been completely friendly
p239_199 Tiger is not the norm
p239_200 It's been a humbling year
p239_201 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p239_202 Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces
p239_203 It is all to do with the coaching
p239_204 There was a fine line to tread
p239_205 The refund is fully justified
p239_206 My wife and family are the support system
p239_207 We are now working with full-time on future product
p239_208 He has many offers from the English Premiership
p239_209 He is a very talented player
p239_210 Bottling is now the core business
p239_211 I would be surprised if he decided to give up
p239_212 The protest will go ahead as planned
p239_213 People have been wonderful beyond belief
p239_214 The music is therefore profoundly subversive
p239_215 That group reported just before Christmas
p239_216 We had to add value
p239_217 Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes
p239_218 IT S all change at Kilmarnock
p239_219 So I got a blood test
p239_220 Russell did not appeal the committee's decision
p239_221 I was caught out a little bit
p239_222 There's always the next century
p239_223 The business has expanded rapidly, however
p239_224 But it's an enjoyable job
p239_225 Finding suitable replacements would not be easy
p239_226 There's only one team in Ayrshire
p239_227 Initial market reaction was close to euphoric
p239_228 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p239_229 Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow
p239_230 She had gone to the Catholic school
p239_231 Then we will face the Danish champions
p239_232 It would seem a natural progression
p239_233 Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement
p239_234 We will turn the corner
p239_235 Of course, it is a tough assignment
p239_236 My Dad is a hero
p239_237 Jackie is passionate about Scotland
p239_238 Further details are expected later
p239_239 This is absolutely not true
p239_240 They should stop the bombing
p239_241 These days are long gone
p239_242 And they were being paid ?
p239_243 was everything done to save people ?
p239_244 What was the matter for concern ?
p239_245 Do I think about them often ?
p239_246 Not a great deal has changed in the last decade
p239_247 I've learned from my mistakes
p239_248 Adams is surely worth a chance
p239_249 This season has been a mixture of frustration and fulfilment
p239_250 I've come here for the jersey
p239_251 The question is whether private investors should follow their example
p239_252 The strong performance is expected to continue
p239_253 The challenge for the industry is to capture and retain that talent
p239_254 She replied, It could be
p239_255 Allen is strong in every shape and form
p239_256 Her political persuasion is no secret
p239_257 We have a budget in March
p239_258 ADVENTURE is the champagne of life
p239_259 We have expanded too quickly
p239_260 I'd been out with my girlfriend and we were attacked
p239_261 Boats and other equipment would be pooled
p239_262 Stewart Ivory also declined to comment last night
p239_263 Our position remains the same
p239_264 The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups
p239_265 They could not match it
p239_266 He is not a pathetic figure
p239_267 The latter can only account for a small proportion of calls
p239_268 They made such decisions in London
p239_269 This comes down to a problem of arrogance
p239_270 Harrowing is easy, after all
p239_271 Each case is treated on merit
p239_272 A winter of discontent awaits
p239_273 I thought we were fantastic
p239_274 They are determined to make a meaningful contribution
p239_275 It's going to be very closely watched
p239_276 It is fairly specialised and mainly for the export of breeding animals
p239_277 They receive a high profile in the media
p239_278 Our destiny is in our own hands
p239_279 Miller was every bit as happy
p239_280 Even more harrowing, though, was the reception from her husband and manager
p239_281 Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute
p239_282 There is no internal damage
p239_283 We've had great things in the past
p239_284 It could be done by experts and lawyers
p239_285 It has been recorded twice
p239_286 Aberdeen had little to offer
p239_287 However, Dundee deserved to win this game
p239_288 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p239_289 This youngster is so exciting!
p239_290 It was a pre-emptive strike
p239_291 Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope
p239_292 They will probably come back
p239_293 This is a good incentive for both parties to conclude
p239_294 I saw them last week
p239_295 Friday night was a pretty good night
p239_296 This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds
p239_297 You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice
p239_298 We may need to take some very radical measures
p239_299 Everyone can have their opinion
p239_300 The best thing for me was to join the Army
p239_301 Celtic are delaying the question of a new contract
p239_302 Mr McLeod said he believed a solution would be reached
p239_303 The early goal was a shock to the system for Hearts
p239_304 That should give me a chance
p239_305 They have played their part
p239_306 This will be our new beginning
p239_307 They have the cash and the fire power
p239_308 Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon
p239_309 The company hopes to repeat the process in France
p239_310 Racism has no place in any sport
p239_311 Celtic were the losers then
p239_312 What do we want to do that for ?
p239_313 Does the name matter ?
p239_314 how do you get it back ?
p239_315 What are you not good at ?
p239_316 I think, therefore I am ?
p239_317 Who was she ?
p239_318 The result is utterly compelling
p239_319 The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday
p239_320 I have been very nervous
p239_321 Confidence among the allies began to slip
p239_322 There were also some interesting questions and answers
p239_323 I won't make an official complaint
p239_324 It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed
p239_325 It wasn't about her singing, though
p239_326 They are looking at a flotation
p239_327 They make a selective perception process
p239_328 Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match
p239_329 He was admitted to hospital
p239_330 Thereafter they were allowed to proceed
p239_331 It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years
p239_332 January is a bad time of year
p239_333 And they haven't taken the foot off the gas
p239_334 Royal Bank declined to comment
p239_335 From there, they can go anywhere
p239_336 Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning
p239_337 Twaddle is a case in point
p239_338 We used to live with dignity in our country
p239_339 My daughter is an adult
p239_340 It will affect their work
p239_341 Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago
p239_342 I am considered a teenager
p239_343 Anyway, the job will be part-time
p239_344 The FBI could become involved
p239_345 Another High Street retailer was not so lucky
p239_346 I just felt that I was broken down
p239_347 And the World Cup has not even begun
p239_348 It comes from reflection or thinking
p239_349 This is the version which appeared in our paper
p239_350 Translation - we got it wrong
p239_351 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p239_352 They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters
p239_353 What happened in that game ?
p239_354 Are you going to win ?
p239_355 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p239_356 So, did she meet him ?
p239_357 So what is the campaign about ?
p239_358 The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Florida in October
p239_359 William Hague delighted his party
p239_360 That moment when the monster is being brought to life
p239_361 We can't give any figures for Edinburgh
p239_362 Walker plans to return indoors
p239_363 The actual increases will be announced next month
p239_364 The statement contained no surprises
p239_365 The scientific debate is dead
p239_366 This would include the GM food industry
p239_367 But the rally was short-lived
p239_368 Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh
p239_369 They are the innocent victims
p239_370 It didn't matter who was in their way
p239_371 He ended up a headmaster
p239_372 That took about two years
p239_373 He is obviously very dangerous
p239_374 That remains the unanswered question
p239_375 This should come as no surprise
p239_376 It was launched in February last year
p239_377 Commitment is released on Liberty
p239_378 I love the spectacle of cinema
p239_379 He did not say that
p239_380 Pensions are a long-term investment
p239_381 We have not been approached
p239_382 Murray Johnstone will replace it
p239_383 North African countries are also seen as potential customers
p239_384 The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high
p239_385 Those overseas offices were great
p239_386 Well, that's just a third district
p239_387 She asked for the appointment with me
p239_388 Subs not used, McKenzie, Ritchie
p239_389 A new school will be built
p239_390 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p239_391 How are you, sir ?
p239_392 So is that it, then ?
p239_393 Do I have a favourite ?
p239_394 His leader wanted to celebrate
p239_395 Venus rejects the very suggestion
p239_396 This fact is supported by audience research
p239_397 Because of that I didn't enjoy the game
p239_398 We were beaten by the better team
p239_399 Both sides have to step back
p239_400 Analysts were impressed with progress made
p239_401 Everything has its place and purpose
p239_402 I have received no explanation
p239_403 Turnover was highest in telecoms
p239_404 Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country
p239_405 He also launched a new strategy for the agency
p239_406 This game is very evenly balanced
p239_407 Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential
p239_408 It seems a waste of talents
p239_409 Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service
p239_410 We lost our composure towards the interval, he said
p239_411 You can feel at home in China
p239_412 This would discourage investment and job creation
p239_413 We have no information on Iraq
p239_414 It depends on Labour, not on us
p239_415 Autumn is the time of fulfilment
p239_416 You're not getting any goodwill
p239_417 The baby deserves the credit
p239_418 Washington is consumed by the crisis
p239_419 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p239_420 I should think so, too
p239_421 It makes no difference to their friendship
p239_422 It needs to be sorted out by Easter
p239_423 It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused
p239_424 The capital costs are modest
p239_425 Scoring in our first game was a bonus for me
p239_426 It certainly feels that way
p239_427 This idea has been around for four years
p239_428 Or maybe it's the other way around
p239_429 We are facing a health disaster if we do not act
p239_430 We accept the new rules
p239_431 Blair is very positive at European Councils
p239_432 They are interior designers and architects
p239_433 He was released after treatment
p239_434 All the pieces fit together perfectly
p239_435 Five minutes later, the home team were back in front
p239_436 I also had a lot of injuries, which did not help me
p239_437 Things are going to change over the next six months
p239_438 Last year's winner was Sergio Garcia
p239_439 The potential for Scottish beef is not limited to carcasses
p239_440 It is also very valuable
p239_441 The stage was set for a showdown
p239_442 This could put pressure on UK inflation
p239_443 They should not feel under threat
p239_444 Any error is severely punished
p239_445 Either group is living in fantasy land
p239_446 That will be a decision for BBC Scotland
p239_447 Hard cash is needed now
p239_448 Her housekeeper discovered the break-in on Thursday morning
p239_449 Blair also had a penalty
p239_450 Frankly, we should all have such problems
p239_451 Either way, it's very funny
p239_452 We didn't want any trouble
p239_453 It seemed a logical expansion
p239_454 Similar measures are expected in England and Wales
p239_455 And Michael was just great
p239_456 Now it has doubled in size
p239_457 It was never a free kick
p239_458 They failed to reach agreement yesterday
p239_459 This is a great opportunity for us
p239_460 Further savings would arise from common procurement and IT systems
p239_461 Inventories are coming under control
p239_462 She failed in her action
p239_463 We will provide immediate access
p239_464 We also acknowledge the grief and pain of their relatives
p239_465 Recent reports suggested it might be sold off
p239_466 Several hundred people attended yesterday
p239_467 Dunfermline manager Jimmy Calderwood was candid
p239_468 The money is within the total allocation
p239_469 The partnership was set up during the summer
p239_470 This does not create any precedent
p239_471 There's nothing I can say
p239_472 We need a visionary producer
p239_473 The response from everyone was wonderful
p239_474 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p239_475 I am sorry, but I forgot
p239_476 Banking stocks were hit hard
p239_477 We did something about it
p239_478 The criminal justice system doesn't deliver
p239_479 Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday
p239_480 Five years later, the deception continued
p239_481 The rescue package is public money
p239_482 The death toll included five children
p239_483 Again the parallel with football can be drawn
p239_484 Sales have been perfectly buoyant
p239_485 I was there five months ago
p239_486 It happened again, and again, and again
p239_487 It could well be military
p239_488 Holland won by five wickets
p239_489 Other casualties were averted by the swift response of the emergency services
p239_490 They cannot operate without a licence from the local authority
p239_491 It's unlikely to be renewed
p239_492 MOVIE stars are public property
p239_493 I first met him last summer
p239_494 The songs are just so good
p239_495 The whole thing was just unreal
p239_496 I can hardly believe it
p239_497 They haven't been thought through
p239_498 Saturday's match was fairly straightforward
p239_499 I am not unduly surprised
p239_500 Iain Duncan Smith is wrong
p239_501 You are a different people
p239_502 McPherson came from United Biscuits
p239_503 The world record is suspicious
p240_001 Please call Stella
p240_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p240_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p240_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p240_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p240_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p240_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p240_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p240_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p240_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p240_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p240_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p240_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p240_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p240_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p240_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p240_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p240_018 Aristotle thought the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p240_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p240_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p240_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p240_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p240_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p240_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p240_025 Johnson was pretty low
p240_026 But it failed
p240_027 Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format
p240_028 Is this accurate?
p240_029 I am not interested in the money, it is the principle
p240_030 They should have a major rethink about the event for next year
p240_031 We want to ensure that the process is entirely transparent
p240_032 They were described as being in a serious but stable condition yesterday
p240_033 This is the window
p240_034 People love to see this stuff
p240_035 He took me on a tour of the wards
p240_036 It is marvellous
p240_037 Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night
p240_038 It has failed
p240_039 They're just different
p240_040 It's a real threat
p240_041 It was the eighties
p240_042 Indeed, he does
p240_043 President Bush is at war
p240_044 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p240_045 On this showing, they should stick with the lads
p240_046 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p240_047 It is so sad
p240_048 That period was a struggle
p240_049 This represents a tough game for us
p240_050 Who can say?
p240_051 It's a blessing
p240_052 The Yugoslav president said he did not recognise the election outcome
p240_053 Hopefully, it will be built by next year
p240_054 He is too weak to move
p240_055 Rebuilding public transport was never going to happen overnight
p240_056 He had no enemies
p240_057 I got a great response from the players, as I had expected
p240_058 However the drama was still not at an end
p240_059 For the meantime, though, the signs are good
p240_060 That's the truth
p240_061 The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine
p240_062 I've had six days of rehearsal
p240_063 He will now seek to sell his shares in the club
p240_064 Art is extra
p240_065 Scotland had great assets
p240_066 They are real
p240_067 There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music
p240_068 I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset
p240_069 It should be devolved
p240_070 We welcome the decision of Mr Byers
p240_071 It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards
p240_072 I was just trying to win the golf tournament
p240_073 I was as strong as a horse
p240_074 They do not work for Glasgow City Council
p240_075 The girls are so lucky to be alive
p240_076 She died in hospital two hours later
p240_077 Is there a new way forward?
p240_078 I've got the shirt
p240_079 Today she has been released
p240_080 The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday
p240_081 Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat
p240_082 What has changed?
p240_083 He is in the queue
p240_084 He liked to give the impression of being a hard man
p240_085 Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money
p240_086 Someone who cares
p240_087 Florida is the pivotal state in the nation
p240_088 Lord Levy said he started life with nothing
p240_089 They lived for their children
p240_090 That will come after the game on Saturday
p240_091 Today I couldn't run on it
p240_092 She told The Herald
p240_093 We could not get any possession
p240_094 He is hungry for success and I am the same
p240_095 It seemed a moving and fitting tribute
p240_096 They were outside the circle
p240_097 He said he hoped for a first meeting within a few days
p240_098 It was a good performance
p240_099 I see no need for change
p240_100 We have every respect for Michelle
p240_101 But they did not even get a reply to their letter
p240_102 He takes the job
p240_103 They will want to perform well
p240_104 That all hope is never lost
p240_105 It was really enjoyable on Saturday
p240_106 Getting new people interested in this music is the real reward
p240_107 It's in his blood
p240_108 It's a shame
p240_109 It had been played at festivals
p240_110 I came to complete
p240_111 It's a question of perception
p240_112 In the current outbreak, the reverse is true
p240_113 This film will be totally awesome
p240_114 Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants
p240_115 I'm delighted about that
p240_116 Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear
p240_117 I joined a group
p240_118 This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election
p240_119 She really suffered for her art
p240_120 It is a delight on every level
p240_121 You can spend money on housing
p240_122 There were no grounds for his action
p240_123 It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged
p240_124 Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton
p240_125 I was furious
p240_126 His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years
p240_127 It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation
p240_128 Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family
p240_129 I do not think this family will ever get over this
p240_130 Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't
p240_131 Offered the gold medal, he declined
p240_132 It was the same at Twickenham
p240_133 The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council
p240_134 It is also well received
p240_135 Government will intervene
p240_136 Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg
p240_137 He was in a great deal of pain
p240_138 We want to keep the pound
p240_139 It seems so long since I did the exams
p240_140 And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life
p240_141 Wallace was a prisoner of war
p240_142 Who would be right?
p240_143 She died at her home
p240_144 I am just trying to do my job
p240_145 It opens the door to the Champions League
p240_146 It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment
p240_147 They did very well
p240_148 Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe
p240_149 It was deployed in the Gulf War
p240_150 It's amazing, but I have never seen a drug test in Scotland
p240_151 Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment
p240_152 Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat
p240_153 Mr Blair had done well
p240_154 I was in daily contact
p240_155 My Dad is a hero
p240_156 The weather affected the other two games in Fife
p240_157 Hopefully, we can learn from our mistakes
p240_158 Was this element always there?
p240_159 These days are long gone
p240_160 Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks
p240_161 It could take years for the tunnel to be reopened
p240_162 I was in the train station overnight
p240_163 We knew we had the goal we wanted
p240_164 However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands
p240_165 Tell it like it was?
p240_166 We have a budget in March
p240_167 That must be left to the Parole Board
p240_168 By then, however, both men were already in the US
p240_169 They will do their own thing
p240_170 And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers
p240_171 It's quite a routine
p240_172 The event was held in the council's headquarters in Hamilton
p240_173 The hotel was now for sale
p240_174 I drove the ball well
p240_175 Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director
p240_176 They know no other way
p240_177 There is no point in looking any further
p240_178 And she is a successful actor with three decades of experience
p240_179 Sir Jeremy, from Glasgow, said they had been delighted
p240_180 They will run a mile
p240_181 Neither side would reveal the details of the offer
p240_182 They need to look after themselves
p240_183 Miller was every bit as happy
p240_184 What has caused the demise of singing?
p240_185 We want to help them through it
p240_186 They really did a great job
p240_187 It was an odd affair, in many respects
p240_188 It is tough, but possible
p240_189 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p240_190 Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender
p240_191 The procedure is the same in all cases
p240_192 People will ask about us
p240_193 But a final decision will not be taken until after the elections
p240_194 It is a farce
p240_195 I am totally surprised
p240_196 The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small
p240_197 It wasn't to be
p240_198 There was no option
p240_199 There would appear to be no motive for the attack
p240_200 But we are not immune to the problem
p240_201 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p240_202 Who will pay for this?
p240_203 They've got three-quarters of the way
p240_204 The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster
p240_205 I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling
p240_206 It's all about money, money, money
p240_207 We will give a formal response to the report in due course
p240_208 It's a mixture of everything
p240_209 We have an election in eight days
p240_210 The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow
p240_211 We'll have to work hard today
p240_212 She should not be blamed
p240_213 We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence
p240_214 It had all been arranged
p240_215 A Grampian Police spokesman said
p240_216 His third goal was superb
p240_217 I was so nervous
p240_218 Work has started
p240_219 For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon
p240_220 He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda
p240_221 The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo
p240_222 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p240_223 That has been the easy part
p240_224 Women were mostly notable by their absence
p240_225 But it will be sorted out this week
p240_226 What was the main difference?
p240_227 I am immensely sad
p240_228 It is a gamble
p240_229 At the time, he was a living legend
p240_230 It's so special
p240_231 They are the innocent victims
p240_232 Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable
p240_233 The body follows the mind
p240_234 However, no further action was taken by police
p240_235 And thought we would get away with it
p240_236 Jobs could go
p240_237 It is not the message alone
p240_238 It's quite a line-up!
p240_239 It's very safe
p240_240 But it's a subtle process
p240_241 Of further privacy, he had no need
p240_242 He was good, but not that good
p240_243 We were extremely poor
p240_244 Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order
p240_245 In fact, it is deeply unpleasant
p240_246 It is hard won
p240_247 A change in that position would require a decision by the council
p240_248 Jock Brown is appointed as general manager
p240_249 I am the opposite because I haven't played very much
p240_250 I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday
p240_251 In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify
p240_252 He got the same story
p240_253 It is a policy which has the full support of the minister
p240_254 I have a lot of relatives in this part of the country
p240_255 A friendship that will endure
p240_256 He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen
p240_257 Her presence was almost everywhere
p240_258 For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique
p240_259 That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective
p240_260 Blair is very positive at European Councils
p240_261 One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning
p240_262 So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy
p240_263 I was happily surprised
p240_264 They must play for each other
p240_265 It is also very valuable
p240_266 George W Bush, the US president, condemned the attacks
p240_267 Blood samples were taken
p240_268 There is no link
p240_269 This is a question of Islam
p240_270 It looks as though he will be right
p240_271 Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate
p240_272 Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public
p240_273 Have a look at our accounts
p240_274 He was also married with two children
p240_275 And Michael was just great
p240_276 Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes
p240_277 Access has been a nightmare
p240_278 It has been achieved by hard work and careful planning
p240_279 It's a way of life
p240_280 The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline
p240_281 A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes
p240_282 However, he will have his work cut out defending his title
p240_283 People have no choice
p240_284 In essence, the teaching profession has a choice
p240_285 In fact, he was talking about the survival business
p240_286 If not, he should go home
p240_288 His mother refuses to believe that she is dead
p240_289 Surely, the Scottish Parliament is entitled to take a view on that
p240_290 This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter
p240_291 Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished
p240_292 He will address the nation this evening
p240_293 It was a virus
p240_294 Maloney is an engaging talent
p240_295 The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies
p240_296 It's like a high school play
p240_297 Who did the recruiting?
p240_298 He was obviously very genuine
p240_299 She said she could not believe that they had run away
p240_300 Saturday's match was fairly straightforward
p240_301 A new school will be built
p240_302 We have to sort it out ourselves
p240_303 He said she was mad
p240_304 I was the sheep
p240_305 There was no hint of scandal
p240_306 The home was now under new management
p240_307 The whole matter is somewhat in the air
p240_308 We are now looking at the degrees of injury
p240_309 In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge
p240_310 We do not expect any surplus
p240_311 The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn
p240_312 The plot is minimal
p240_313 And he goes with it
p240_314 SCOTLAND has shown the way
p240_315 It is no surprise
p240_316 Let's hope it's an investment in the future
p240_317 The court was shown a video of the house on that day
p240_318 They will certainly be visible from every house in our area
p240_319 They were fantastic
p240_320 There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh
p240_321 We are a peaceful people
p240_322 The election is total confusion and chaos
p240_323 Henman has been warned
p240_324 Craig is a major concern for us
p240_325 It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register
p240_326 It is out there
p240_327 Referees are easy targets
p240_328 They had a confession
p240_329 We do the same
p240_330 That's the law of the land
p240_331 Donald was his friend
p240_332 I am so upset
p240_333 They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden
p240_334 Last night, he pledged to clear his name
p240_335 The police have to act to help them
p240_336 We agreed to disagree
p240_337 It could have gone either way
p240_338 He was then replaced by Ross
p240_339 I saw some good things
p240_340 I've not thought about it
p240_341 Who was the mystery MP?
p240_342 In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times
p240_343 It is a sign of hope
p240_344 Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side
p240_345 Three years ago he would have been
p240_346 Locally, too, the MP is under fire
p240_347 It is so unfair
p240_348 They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance
p240_349 He has to learn
p240_351 Look at the witnesses
p240_352 That is the very reason why it was so vital
p240_353 However, this suggestion was turned down by the player
p240_354 The composer will conduct
p240_355 This is a friendly match?
p240_357 They should take their mobile phones
p240_358 On the front line beyond the bridge the scene was utter chaos
p240_359 However, we will obviously keep the matter under review
p240_360 He had played well in that central role
p240_361 He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal
p240_362 That is a break with tradition
p240_363 A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company
p240_364 The council said the house would have to be demolished
p240_365 They say that vital evidence was not heard in court
p240_366 In addition, it was in breach of natural justice
p240_367 As, indeed, they would be
p240_368 But the real problem is the closure of the export market
p240_369 Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors
p240_370 Hartley should know
p240_371 That would help
p240_372 A deadline is still essential
p240_373 Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported
p240_374 Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment
p240_375 We are looking for perfection
p240_376 On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options
p240_377 He later became a respected High Court judge
p240_378 It's been hard
p240_379 It's now down in black and white
p240_380 Safety was also an issue
p243_001 Please call Stella
p243_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p243_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p243_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p243_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p243_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p243_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p243_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p243_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p243_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p243_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p243_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p243_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p243_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p243_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p243_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p243_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p243_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p243_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p243_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p243_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p243_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p243_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p243_025 He has the right attitude but the wrong approach
p243_026 His secretary said it was a matter for Murray Financial to deal with
p243_027 I've got the same feeling as I had last week in Germany
p243_028 The west coast line is not just for middle England
p243_029 The Budget is a boost for Scottish business
p243_030 She brought a lot to my life
p243_031 Things fall a little flat elsewhere, however
p243_032 Thomson and his family left court without comment
p243_033 I want to give everything to Rangers while I am with the club
p243_034 But the Sunday Herald said it stood by its story
p243_035 It is about control of our economy
p243_036 Each brand was owned by a different family
p243_037 That was not perfect golf by any means
p243_038 He added that her comments were noted
p243_039 She will get through it I'm sure
p243_040 Everyone has to prove a point when they cross that white line
p243_041 Hearts hit back with two goals in four minutes
p243_042 He does not even trust his own members
p243_043 He too started on the subs seats
p243_044 Is it worth it ?
p243_045 Does it matter ?
p243_046 How do you take them away ?
p243_047 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p243_048 After the match, do you ?
p243_049 Has the conflict started ?
p243_050 Have I really come to this ?
p243_051 I'm as fit as I can get
p243_052 We took part in a festival called Global Dance
p243_053 He said he still planned to go ahead with deep tax cuts
p243_054 The important retail business continues to deliver excellent results, Stewart said
p243_055 Andy was a huge influence yet again
p243_056 They seem too much of a sure thing
p243_057 Her husband had been waiting for her return
p243_058 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p243_059 We just want this season to end
p243_060 It was a day she thought she would never see
p243_061 Talks have continued at many different levels
p243_062 The referee is there to decide these things
p243_063 There were no details of the other five victims
p243_064 It also has a good labour supply
p243_065 Indeed he has a lot of output
p243_066 Do not give your details to anyone
p243_067 He was failed by his health authority
p243_068 But it was not all bad news
p243_069 I cannot believe that someone would pay so much for works like these
p243_070 But during the bid process, that changed completely
p243_071 It turned me against the whole system
p243_072 She seemed as moved by her own words as her audience were
p243_073 I saw the story, but that amount wouldn't even pay my commission
p243_074 But two groups refused to sign up
p243_075 I was returning a message he left on my mobile phone yesterday
p243_076 It had little effect on European equity markets
p243_077 I'd sign back up tomorrow if he was back on board
p243_078 The key to the whole project will be environmental concern
p243_079 The squad spent the night at police headquarters
p243_080 They said our costs were too high
p243_081 I do not attempt to answer that
p243_082 It's been a great evening for us
p243_083 That kind of growth is the important thing
p243_084 A regular bus service runs between the hall and the town centre
p243_085 No plan for projects are yet in place
p243_086 Clearly he knows nothing about Glasgow or Glasgow Green
p243_087 I have no problems playing with such capable players in front of me
p243_088 Celtic have a great base of travelling fans
p243_089 I feel I did not have enough time
p243_090 Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee
p243_091 I can't remember a lot about the accident
p243_092 Clark was delighted with the effort of Jones
p243_093 They had the appeal of TV stars
p243_094 There is no issue of national security involved here
p243_095 He will be a very hard act to follow
p243_096 Earlier, both main parties had agreed a crucial stage had been reached
p243_097 Put simply, it goes something like this
p243_098 Over one million people have been forced from their homes
p243_099 Even if he doesn't have any lines
p243_100 I am delighted to hear this news
p243_101 We are already seeing some positive results
p243_102 We will be putting in a written appeal tomorrow morning
p243_103 We were under a bit of pressure
p243_104 They won't actually make any money from it
p243_105 I bought a flat six years ago
p243_106 They would now be able to look forward with confidence
p243_107 They are a different team at home
p243_108 It took around three minutes from beginning to end
p243_109 Scotland is never far away at Westminster
p243_110 Some young girls also came by last night
p243_111 Former Hamilton defender Colin Miller could return to the club today as manager
p243_112 What are they for ?
p243_113 Is there a waiting list ?
p243_114 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p243_115 So what happens next ?
p243_116 Had this been common practice ?
p243_117 What do they want us to do ?
p243_118 The idea is the shop within a shop
p243_119 I left five minutes after he had finished his round
p243_120 It is the right package for Scotland
p243_121 They have no real friends in the region
p243_122 England were ahead until two minutes into injury time
p243_123 Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat
p243_125 I think there's not much between them
p243_126 So I am going in the right direction
p243_127 Now the life of this orchestra is very difficult
p243_128 We have to offer value for money
p243_129 It's so nice to see the reaction on their faces
p243_130 I could live without the attention, he admitted
p243_131 He's got to look after himself now
p243_132 He said a review of the planning process should encourage fresh thinking
p243_133 No country has a similar training programme
p243_134 There is no future in rock music
p243_135 Her research is the second piece by Edinburgh University scientists highlighted recently
p243_136 Therefore, no-one can work full time in these companies
p243_137 The Chancellor will deal from a position of strength
p243_138 We must pay teachers to take rugby in schools
p243_139 The programme has been made with great care
p243_140 There was only one living room, you see
p243_141 I am not under any new pressure
p243_142 The allegations were still under investigation, he added
p243_143 It appears that no holiday is complete without a good row
p243_144 They can break quickly from midfield and carry a scoring threat
p243_145 All eight victims were based in Germany
p243_146 Look, George W Bush will come here in two months
p243_147 You should feel involved in their lives
p243_148 It is open season on the Old Firm
p243_149 Is it in the right place ?
p243_150 Did he trip ?
p243_151 Does that put pressure on us ?
p243_152 Did it work ?
p243_153 Do you think we are a top nation ?
p243_154 Three senior officials were dismissed last week
p243_155 Time may already have run out for this option
p243_156 No contact was made, although the arm was clearly raised
p243_157 When it happened, he could hardly believe it
p243_158 They let you see the world through a fresh pair of eyes
p243_159 As our national coach, Brown is done for
p243_160 A progress report will be published in October
p243_161 This man could yet win over Scottish hearts
p243_162 That will reduce my chance of selection
p243_163 When Germany played there recently, the match took place in the new stadium
p243_164 Surely it can't run for two years
p243_165 But the game is still wide open
p243_166 It is no good thinking about Rangers at this time
p243_167 However, it's possible that Dick can influence some Dutch players to go there
p243_168 I knew that I needed to lower my ball flight
p243_169 We had to work very hard for our points
p243_170 That is a big risk at any price
p243_171 You need a long-term strategy in football
p243_172 He said some things which were better left alone
p243_173 If successful, several records will be made
p243_174 The company hopes to top seven million passengers in its current financial year
p243_175 It didn't come as any great surprise
p243_176 Finally, we decided to put the whole speech in
p243_177 It's just a different way of life
p243_178 Therefore, this type of aircraft is completely safe
p243_179 Nato has left them with no other option
p243_180 I am secure in my own position
p243_181 Traffic was also heavy around Strathclyde Park
p243_182 She is believed to be in South Africa
p243_183 The answer I hope includes the Government - Holyrood and Westminster
p243_184 We have come a long way since then
p243_185 I made my mind up before we came on tour
p243_186 A great player has to win major championships
p243_187 Highland health board has a responsibility here
p243_188 I didn't miss the big house at all
p243_189 The story was not made public by this club
p243_190 That capital would be provided equally by the State and established commercial companies
p243_191 You are not long home from work
p243_192 I am fighting the force of nature
p243_193 It involved everything in terms of behaviour
p243_194 Murray spent the early part of his career elsewhere
p243_195 And they were being paid ?
p243_196 was everything done to save people ?
p243_197 What was the matter for concern ?
p243_198 But they had to be paid for
p243_199 There was no way back for Rangers after that blow
p243_200 The police insisted that they were standard issue
p243_201 One in eight workers in Edinburgh works for Standard Life alone
p243_202 I've never had a year like this
p243_203 Full details are expected to be released in June
p243_204 As you see with the fuel duty business, they do
p243_205 Hague will be leader at the election after next
p243_206 He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery
p243_207 I want an answer from the British Government
p243_208 Gas production was also at record levels last year
p243_209 They are a victim of their own success
p243_210 We knew their goalkeeper would take a chance
p243_211 This is a young squad and we're all supporters
p243_212 It is going to change the world
p243_213 Scottish football yesterday appeared ready to line up alongside the Scotland manager
p243_214 People elsewhere in Scotland will feel cut off by this
p243_215 The study is entirely into the issue of future funding
p243_216 I am not going to judge them
p243_217 I do not see this so much as failure
p243_218 A European final must be the millennium target
p243_219 Scotland will not vote for New Labour next time
p243_220 I was independent but I am not now
p243_221 We hope for a fresh board with a fresh, clear look at things
p243_222 We are still seeking that complete performance
p243_223 My targets for the Scottish Conservative party are high
p243_224 Someone should force President Bush to watch this film
p243_225 The price was raised after massive demand from retail investors
p243_226 If not, a deal could take many months
p243_227 This takes no account of hotel and tourism losses
p243_228 Royal Bank provided debt funding for the deals
p243_229 I want to see as much progress as possible
p243_230 This is certainly not the time for attempts at trial by media
p243_231 I felt we played some excellent football in the first half
p243_232 The mother and daughter had moved into the property about six months ago
p243_233 They should realise the chairman wants a deputy he can trust
p243_234 The labour side has developed in the North area
p243_235 You are not allowed to do that
p243_236 That is the last thing they need
p243_237 He has worked for several years in the United States
p243_238 The children were later able to leave by bus
p243_239 Jim was down there with his wife
p243_240 Was it the wife ?
p243_241 Why change it ?
p243_242 What do we want to do that for ?
p243_243 Does the name matter ?
p243_244 how do you get it back ?
p243_245 What are you not good at ?
p243_246 I think, therefore I am ?
p243_247 Church leaders warned other homes could close
p243_248 The pair will meet again in Glasgow, and then train together in Australia
p243_249 My first New Year's wish is for him to change his mind
p243_250 He has many offers from the English Premiership
p243_251 However, the figures tell a different story
p243_252 The rise has come too late for some
p243_253 Rangers then had a couple of good efforts
p243_254 I'd rather play well next week than here
p243_255 Edinburgh Prison will also require to be seen
p243_256 The British Government should follow the Irish example
p243_257 Commercial producers were present in large numbers
p243_258 Despite his success, things began to fall apart
p243_259 Policy making would become a role for ministers and their officials
p243_260 And they never show the same film as a rival
p243_261 Every player goes through this after a serious injury
p243_262 There would be a north and south division
p243_263 The same trend showed up throughout Britain
p243_264 The two companies were not for sale
p243_265 His condition was described as serious last night
p243_266 The full Cabinet will meet today to discuss the oil crisis
p243_267 The board do not own the company
p243_268 Last night Bush carried it rather easily
p243_269 They always want to give a performance
p243_270 Its primary business channel is the internet
p243_271 That's been the difference between the sides
p243_272 The lack of joint action left many analysts concerned
p243_273 I think I was about four years old
p243_274 Meanwhile, the Trust presented its first grant awards for Scotland yesterday
p243_275 It is also seeking a national mortgage rescue plan
p243_276 Despite Labour's recent problems, it has not been able to do that
p243_277 I think the shares are good value
p243_278 One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas
p243_279 Yesterday's session was the last full one before Christmas
p243_280 The life office will now stay with Abbey
p243_281 Analysts believed the market would welcome the group's plan
p243_282 Overall, the last hole was good to the women
p243_283 He may be ready for first team action in March
p243_284 The fans pay for their season tickets
p243_286 In fact, I have been a bit of a terrorist to the council
p243_287 Wall Street provided the British market with little fresh direction
p243_288 No-one had seen this sort of thing before
p243_289 We played well at Aberdeen, though we lost
p243_290 He has been chosen as captain because of the person he is
p243_291 He would get into any world team
p243_292 Its work includes dealing with child abuse
p243_293 They first met during a Step in London
p243_294 The agreement remains the only show in town
p243_295 The question is whether private investors should follow their example
p243_296 The strong performance is expected to continue
p243_297 Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors
p243_298 It is based on population rather than need
p243_299 He could understand both points of view
p243_300 So, did she meet him ?
p243_301 So what is the campaign about ?
p243_302 And does it ?
p243_303 Are you from the rugby ?
p243_304 Had I heard ?
p243_305 What happened in that game ?
p243_306 Are you going to win ?
p243_308 Further heavy charges are expected this year
p243_309 It happened on average once a week this year
p243_310 This is the version which appeared in our paper
p243_311 He is keen to stay in public service
p243_312 Of course people will try the things they see on TV
p243_313 For that reason cover should not be given
p243_314 He felt too close to head office
p243_315 If you believe in the blue and white
p243_316 A report on their property is due within days
p243_317 He will just go on doing his job
p243_318 I always felt they played for me
p243_319 That's the danger when you have to play too many young players
p243_320 The team spirit that was here last year is again good
p243_321 This term they are second bottom with three games left to play
p243_322 We will not simply hit these people
p243_323 We still think this trade is on the increase
p243_324 It is not either national standards or local control
p243_325 His name was first linked last year to Business for Scotland
p243_326 I feel as if I can hole everything now
p243_327 I try to be open to experience
p243_328 He is not exactly a pretty child
p243_329 I thought the race was a little bit slow
p243_330 If I didn't go for the world record, I'd feel guilty
p243_331 Having a Scot play against us would not achieve that
p243_332 I felt it was time for me to leave to develop my career
p243_333 These options include the possible merger or sale of the company
p243_334 One royal, however, was himself criticised yesterday
p243_335 Sports Secretary Chris Smith welcomed the action
p243_336 I hope numbers will be up on last time
p243_337 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p243_338 How are you, sir ?
p243_339 So is that it, then ?
p243_340 Do I have a favourite ?
p243_341 Put another way, they just won't do it
p243_342 Perhaps she met her husband too early, she says
p243_343 Getting that balance right can be very difficult
p243_344 Martin O Neill called this game almost exactly right
p243_345 Neither police nor hotel management had any record of the incident
p243_346 It was a bit like having children
p243_347 And the top prize draw award is certainly impressive
p243_348 And that is the bottom line - box office
p243_349 I'm extremely confident something will happen within the next couple of days
p243_350 I think the guilty ones speak for the whole lot of us
p243_352 Sales will begin by the end of October
p243_353 The executive has so far not offered any immediate prospect of major change
p243_354 Friday night was a pretty good night
p243_355 It is not a material issue for a group with our strength
p243_356 The deal is expected to be completed by September
p243_357 It is the only natural British site on the list
p243_358 His style was direct and very human
p243_359 Under Alex Ferguson, Aberdeen showed it could be done
p243_360 They have the cash and the fire power
p243_361 The institute board will take the decision
p243_362 He's young enough and he must learn
p243_363 Such a policy is for long-term strength
p243_364 Both players gave so much to the side
p243_365 Stephen has never considered the question of compensation
p243_366 The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday
p243_367 The dead woman and the injured man have not yet been named
p243_368 It was a goal which came from nothing
p243_369 We have a substantial value of assets on the ground
p243_370 I have come here to show support for the families
p243_371 We have been going for three years
p243_372 He really played us into a corner
p243_373 They know the truth, they really know the truth
p243_374 It was another black day for Ayrshire
p243_375 Otherwise, we might as well hold it now
p243_376 It used to be all hard sell
p243_377 The direct effects on trade will be limited
p243_378 He had got himself into trouble with money and needed money
p243_379 He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland
p243_380 This is an audience determined to enjoy themselves
p243_381 This is not a small amount of money
p243_382 The doctors say that he will be fine for the performance next week
p243_383 I just felt that I was broken down
p243_384 What do we do ?
p243_385 Why do it otherwise ?
p243_386 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p243_387 The cost of this failure will not hit the Commission
p243_388 Similar increases have been experienced by the medical defence unions
p243_389 He remains a main board director of Royal
p243_390 His record on Government has always been highly effective
p243_391 My tax affairs have been totally open
p243_392 Five years ago its return was rejected
p243_393 But soon the game dropped back into its old ways
p243_394 In my opinion, any transfer to a foreign club will help him progress
p243_395 In that situation, they thought we should be beaten
p243_396 We are keen to see truth and justice
p243_397 The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn
p243_398 People have a wish to charge twice
p244_001 Please call Stella
p244_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p244_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p244_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p244_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p244_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p244_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p244_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p244_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p244_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p244_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p244_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p244_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p244_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p244_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p244_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p244_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p244_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain

p244_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p244_025 We are a service industry
p244_026 It may be good for the soul
p244_027 We want to lift the cup for the fans
p244_028 I am not interested in the money, it is the principle
p244_029 It is about investing in the future
p244_030 However, the following year the cancer returned
p244_031 They were in good humour, too
p244_032 The end result is the same
p244_033 It is on the internet
p244_034 These awards will deliver improvements on the ground
p244_035 IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does
p244_036 This is a central issue
p244_037 History is in the making
p244_038 Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy
p244_039 She was there for the start of the campaign
p244_040 She was at the top
p244_041 In London today, it was business as usual
p244_042 And they had a case
p244_043 Something has to be put in place
p244_044 If we cannot succeed in this endeavour, then so be it
p244_045 They are going after them
p244_046 It is all about the story
p244_047 The whole thing is the music
p244_048 In fact, they are the future of investment
p244_049 That is still the case
p244_050 At the moment, we do not know the extent of their injuries
p244_051 In my view, it has to be done
p244_052 The pressure on the players will build
p244_053 Their campaign is in disarray
p244_054 But, after a dip in sales, growth was recorded
p244_055 Yesterday, he was busy in his office
p244_056 It has been a horrible, horrible time
p244_057 Clearly, they had other problems
p244_058 This trend is likely to strengthen
p244_059 For the meantime, though, the signs are good
p244_060 We have got to deliver
p244_061 That was the difference today
p244_062 The company continues to grow
p244_063 He said it was for sale
p244_064 We felt it was sufficient
p244_065 That is all in the past
p244_066 There is a lot to be done
p244_067 But that's another story for another day
p244_068 He has not been dropped
p244_069 It was an outstanding performance
p244_070 I can't remember a lot about the accident
p244_071 Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued
p244_072 It is only the beginning
p244_073 Everything happened so quickly, that we were taken by surprise
p244_074 Only water is currently allowed
p244_075 This time, it might be for real
p244_076 She did that for the rest of her life
p244_077 Seriously, we are not concerned at all
p244_078 That will be the office
p244_079 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p244_080 How are you, sir ?
p244_081 So is that it, then ?
p244_082 Do I have a favourite ?
p244_083 What do we do ?
p244_084 Why do it otherwise ?
p244_085 It starts with the script
p244_086 Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision
p244_087 It would have been around the turn of the century
p244_088 I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier
p244_089 Thankfully, Mr Campbell was able to help
p244_090 It seems a good thing to try
p244_091 However, he stressed that no decision had yet been made
p244_092 It sounds a lot of money
p244_093 However, a ruling will not come before next week
p244_094 It is not a story
p244_095 However, we will obviously keep the matter under review
p244_096 He is in the US
p244_097 I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February
p244_098 It took an option on the process
p244_099 By then, he was walking on water
p244_100 This is a game of confidence
p244_101 On Saturday, it was much the same
p244_102 He liked the weather, the courses, the food
p244_103 The door is still open, but we need a bit of help
p244_104 The trick is to try it
p244_105 I had no intention of misleading anyone
p244_106 Victory was never in doubt
p244_107 This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit
p244_108 On this occasion, the case for a public inquiry was not made
p244_109 Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack
p244_110 Then again, we could have
p244_111 There, you were just a body
p244_112 But he has not become a monster
p244_113 He is not a dancer
p244_114 We had planned to sell the property for some time
p244_115 A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury
p244_116 In the end we have to take a stand
p244_117 This is a sea change in approach
p244_118 Otherwise, the market may come back
p244_119 The procedures were not in place
p244_120 For these people, the ruling is very welcome
p244_121 In the end, we did not spend a penny on him
p244_122 He was not alone at the top of the board
p244_123 The announcement of a preferred bidder is expected at the same time
p244_124 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p244_125 We had a great time
p244_126 I am delighted to have been the captain of the winning side
p244_127 According to criteria, he is qualified for Scotland
p244_128 It was far from business as usual
p244_129 He wanted to record the group
p244_130 He leaves a wife, a son and a daughter
p244_131 Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals
p244_132 It is hard to believe
p244_133 Or it would have been
p244_134 Three days later, he was killed
p244_135 Football is a passion for many
p244_136 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p244_137 So, did she meet him ?
p244_138 So what is the campaign about ?
p244_139 And does it ?
p244_140 Are you from the rugby ?
p244_141 However, the bank denied that he was in the running
p244_142 That was the first step
p244_143 However, the City was in no doubt about the ultimate result
p244_144 I have been in contact with him
p244_145 Actors like to be in the centre
p244_146 When we played them last year, we were beaten by the weather
p244_147 They could not ignore the will of parliament, he claimed
p244_148 I am the manager of Scotland
p244_149 There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end
p244_150 There were no grounds for his action
p244_151 I can't even get into the A team
p244_152 It starts at the top
p244_153 Others are expected to follow the lead
p244_154 She does not want to speak
p244_155 It was all for good reason as well
p244_156 One letter from a teacher arrived at Christmas
p244_157 It is the latter which has prompted the warning
p244_158 As for the warning, it was not needed
p244_159 If not, a deal could take many months
p244_160 We want to get there
p244_161 On Friday, the headteacher and deputy headteacher appeared at the door
p244_162 There is a lack of staff
p244_163 Not that the occasion was without restraint
p244_164 Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray
p244_165 This would indicate a surge in inflation was unlikely
p244_166 At last, in the third year, a letter has arrived
p244_167 Full consent is expected by the end of next year
p244_168 Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition
p244_169 Anyone can do the sums
p244_170 We have to create it in the playing strength of the team
p244_171 It is not about the money, it is about everything
p244_172 Details will be published in The Herald in the coming weeks
p244_173 We were all over the place in the first half
p244_174 Like the others, he was arrested
p244_175 All the pressure was on him
p244_176 Charles Gordon, leader of Glasgow City Council declined to comment
p244_177 They have not been named
p244_178 It sounds like an appalling, tragic incident
p244_179 I think the Labour party is completely split on this
p244_180 It is ambitious, but it can be achieved
p244_181 I was always in control
p244_182 It was by the numbers
p244_183 I would like to see the figures for the second quarter
p244_184 It should never have happened
p244_185 Inside, the atmosphere was quiet
p244_186 The feeling is hard to describe
p244_187 It is difficult to say
p244_188 That is a question for the next manager
p244_189 By then, however, both men were already in the US
p244_190 However, he urged the trade to keep the faith
p244_191 It is simply not true
p244_192 Are you going to win ?
p244_193 Was it the wife ?
p244_194 Why change it ?
p244_195 What do we want to do that for ?
p244_196 Does the name matter ?
p244_197 That you can do it
p244_198 I would like to continue to develop
p244_199 First and foremost, the game is entirely different
p244_200 He has defended the system
p244_201 We want to begin a programme in the UK
p244_203 At the top level, the salaries are far too high
p244_204 It is not an issue
p244_205 They have to get that sorted
p244_206 We can take the city
p244_207 He played it like a veteran
p244_208 It was the story of the second half
p244_209 Many referees are on a hiding to nothing
p244_210 As many as the market will support
p244_211 He is believed to live in Britain
p244_212 Hopefully, it will bring new customers
p244_213 The report was welcomed by the Law Society of Scotland
p244_214 This conference was never confirmed
p244_215 A team is a team
p244_216 However, Murray Johnstone is not on the menu
p244_217 I'm interested in interesting work
p244_218 It decided to blame the media
p244_219 THE force is with them
p244_220 This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds
p244_221 It was important to win today
p244_222 He was not injured in the attack
p244_223 Because he was born in England
p244_224 Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon
p244_225 Milk producers were in need of immediate assistance, he said
p244_226 I was not overly concerned about this
p244_227 However, it is not as simple as this
p244_228 We want this place to work
p244_229 It still has an effect
p244_230 The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office
p244_231 I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling
p244_232 Other villages were completely deserted
p244_233 There is a lot of concern
p244_234 It will be decided in the next month
p244_235 We have to win the group
p244_236 It seemed a moving and fitting tribute
p244_237 We're not seeing an image of the person, he said
p244_238 We have an election in eight days
p244_239 There was a lot of resentment
p244_240 This is a fight to the death
p244_241 All will be revealed in due course
p244_242 He is a man of the people
p244_243 The matter is under appeal
p244_244 And they were being paid ?
p244_245 was everything done to save people ?
p244_246 What was the matter for concern ?
p244_247 Do I think about them often ?
p244_248 Is it in the right place ?
p244_249 Did he trip ?
p244_250 Sadly, it could not be done
p244_251 I wouldn't even respond to that question
p244_252 Investors were also concerned about margin pressure
p244_253 Instead, he missed the lot
p244_254 I was never in danger
p244_255 A lot has been written
p244_256 In this case, the farmer had actually given permission
p244_257 It was really good in the first week
p244_258 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p244_259 However, the ball refused to sit for the Frenchman
p244_260 That is not the case in Europe
p244_261 But it was a loss
p244_262 So far, the problems have occurred in the US
p244_263 The performance continues to improve
p244_264 It expected this trend to continue
p244_265 However, no further action was taken by police
p244_266 It depends on Labour, not on us
p244_267 But we were in control at that point
p244_268 It has to be enforced
p244_269 The party has never fully recovered
p244_270 Moreover, it must be for all sports
p244_271 But the government has so far failed to listen
p244_272 He must have a crack at it
p244_273 I am still waiting for a reply
p244_274 Sadly, it sounds as if it is
p244_275 He was good, but not that good
p244_276 The company still had the confidence of its bankers, he said
p244_277 Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise
p244_278 However, the matter is not going to end there
p244_279 It might be sad, but it's a fact
p244_280 In fact, it is deeply unpleasant
p244_281 Obviously, we would want to look at this
p244_282 On a practical level, it would be difficult
p244_283 If so, it is a funny time to introduce it
p244_284 It is important that he is involved
p244_285 If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help
p244_286 It should be noted that he has been released without charge
p244_287 In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win
p244_288 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p244_290 I should think so, too
p244_291 None of the agencies was able to help
p244_292 I didn't see the point
p244_293 This idea has been around for four years
p244_294 We are in a war
p244_295 Do you think we are a top nation ?
p244_296 Is our children learning ?
p244_297 How independent is that ?
p244_298 What form did that take ?
p244_299 Are they free ?
p244_300 Scotland won by six wickets
p244_301 However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely
p244_302 This is a historic agreement
p244_303 We have to be realistic
p244_304 Every one is a winner
p244_305 There was a hole in it
p244_306 It will be done in stages
p244_307 It all started with a visiting rugby club
p244_308 Every character was completely different
p244_309 But it is a similar problem
p244_310 In the UK, inflation data will be published this morning
p244_311 But it is important for a number of reasons
p244_312 In that moment, I was happy
p244_313 All of the management has invested in the firm
p244_314 It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence
p244_315 They were not at the property yesterday
p244_316 It involved the same people
p244_317 We want to get back into the Champions League
p244_318 We have to be very, very careful
p244_319 Look at the potential of this club
p244_320 Hopefully, this week will be good
p244_321 This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter
p244_322 We did something about it
p244_323 But it is up again
p244_324 However, the devil is in the detail
p244_325 For the moment, however, the position is clear
p244_326 The suggestion is the market is not instantly attracted
p244_327 He is already in place
p244_328 Another difference is the cost
p244_329 Overall, we continue to look to the future with confidence
p244_330 And we can do it
p244_331 What are they for ?
p244_333 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p244_334 Tax is a matter for national governments
p244_335 And it's a goodbye from him
p244_336 It is a sensitive issue
p244_337 They have to be addressed
p244_338 This isn't a betrayal of public services, it's their renewal
p244_339 Like many companies, it is a problem
p244_340 The business is mainly active in Europe, the US and Australia
p244_341 However, a bid was never made
p244_342 That is the lesson of the last three weeks
p244_343 Something is going to have to give
p244_344 And the context is also completely different
p244_345 The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn
p244_346 The banking sector was weak
p244_347 But the New Year was special
p244_348 We never played at all
p244_349 However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart
p244_350 This isn't the end of story
p244_351 He is a great prospect
p244_352 He has been told by the doctor to rest
p244_353 However, Walker remains determined to fight the proposals
p244_354 Of course, it does not have to be this way
p244_355 This latter suggestion is very important
p244_356 However, it does not tell the full story
p244_357 They were impressive against France
p244_358 The challenge is to win a cup
p244_359 Hopefully, he will get a lucky break
p244_360 It was a test in itself
p244_361 Either team will be hard
p244_362 The parents will have a great time, too
p244_363 At first, the youngster was not keen
p244_364 However, it has to be seen as part of a package
p244_365 On Thursday, Mr Blair will address the Institute of Public Policy Research
p244_366 In fact, it was almost as if it was expected
p244_367 Lately, that market has come under pressure
p244_368 In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times
p244_369 However, it was well worth the wait
p244_370 The commitment was not long, and it was worth the risk
p244_371 I have a good feeling about this
p244_372 The news is not all bad
p244_373 Some of the passing was a disgrace
p244_374 However, it does not seem to be the case
p244_375 It is almost certain to be the last
p244_376 You have to be patient
p244_377 However, the appeal judges rejected the argument
p244_378 I was delighted to accept
p244_379 A few days after making the video, I went to the inquiry
p244_380 We are not going to fight in Kosovo
p244_381 Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance
p244_382 It's fantastic to win again
p244_383 For businesses, the benefits will be enormous
p244_384 The company won the first round but lost on appeal
p244_385 Everything is in the mix
p244_386 An announcement is expected this week
p244_387 He will be difficult to replace
p244_388 I would be interested in another attempt
p244_389 In addition, it was in breach of natural justice
p244_390 He was on a mission
p244_391 Does it matter ?
p244_392 How do you take them away ?
p244_393 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p244_394 After the match, do you ?
p244_395 One-third of the places are already taken
p244_396 I understand the frustration of the fans
p244_397 Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported
p244_398 On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options
p244_399 I want this one to be different
p244_400 It is the last meeting of the season
p244_401 Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat
p244_402 We have to create a climate of trust, which is not easy
p244_403 He is a quality player
p244_404 The service is expected to be introduced in December
p244_405 It's all been about the basics of the business
p244_406 There is a demand for it
p244_407 It's great that it happened in Britain
p244_408 I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role
p244_409 They are not going the length of the pitch
p244_410 Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter
p244_411 However, the players should have a voice in these matters
p244_412 Thankfully, Peter had already found another outlet for his talents
p244_413 Hopefully, it will come from someone on our side
p244_414 In order to get there, we have got to invest
p244_415 Overall, the labour market continued to tighten
p244_416 There is no need to panic
p244_417 It had been on the cards
p244_418 However, he said the proposal was at an early stage
p244_419 Building an underground, for example, has proved a nightmare
p244_420 That might mean another delay
p244_421 One day, he threw the baby against a wall
p244_422 I am delighted for them
p244_423 He's had to suffer for the last six years
p244_424 But it was a struggle
p250_001 Please call Stella
p250_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p250_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p250_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p250_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p250_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p250_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p250_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p250_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p250_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p250_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p250_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p250_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p250_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p250_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p250_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p250_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p250_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p250_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p250_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p250_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p250_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p250_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p250_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p250_025 A shortlist is to be drawn up next month
p250_026 Meetings will also remain private
p250_027 I am pretty careful with money
p250_028 Last night, Mr Robertson said he was delighted
p250_030 This is a central issue
p250_031 We will not tolerate it
p250_032 Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy
p250_033 He works at the airport
p250_034 Smoking is also very important
p250_035 Mr Darling yesterday dismissed the criticism
p250_036 It was just appalling luck
p250_037 Rugby has an extended run
p250_038 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p250_039 Costs have got to be controlled
p250_040 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p250_042 No meaningful response was issued
p250_043 This represents a tough game for us
p250_044 I made a terrible start
p250_045 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p250_046 How are you, sir ?
p250_047 So is that it, then ?
p250_048 Do I have a favourite ?
p250_049 It comes from reflection or thinking

p250_054 I had trouble with the producers
p250_055 The teacher would have approved
p250_056 The City welcomed the brighter outlook
p250_057 I expect a rapid response
p250_058 She said she was really sorry
p250_059 The problems are a result of that shortfall
p250_060 There's still plenty time left
p250_061 Let's hope that it does
p250_062 We have to keep our clients
p250_063 The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow
p250_064 Companies are now seeking to recover their losses
p250_065 This is the first step
p250_066 We will pay their bills
p250_067 We are talking about the outskirts of London
p250_068 The Farmer wants a new campaign
p250_069 Only water is currently allowed

p250_072 Robin Williams is very subdued
p250_073 It wasn't possible to relax
p250_074 We need to increase the membership
p250_075 There's nothing they can get on me
p250_076 I was as strong as a horse
p250_077 He was a lovely man
p250_078 Both sides have been hit by injury
p250_079 We had a court hearing in London yesterday
p250_080 After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction
p250_081 It makes for an interesting conference
p250_082 I've had it for the exams
p250_083 This view was echoed by the other Scottish analyst
p250_084 The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office
p250_085 They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life
p250_086 He put some colour into Scottish history
p250_087 They lived for their children
p250_088 Potions said he would drive
p250_089 I think the industry needs a big idea to rebuild confidence
p250_090 William Hague, the guest of honour, was delighted
p250_091 We are progressing with a few interested parties
p250_092 That view is held by many others within the industry
p250_093 The excitement could hardly be contained
p250_094 The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation
p250_095 It is high time to act
p250_096 Why do it otherwise ?
p250_097 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p250_098 So, did she meet him ?
p250_099 So what is the campaign about ?
p250_100 And does it ?
p250_101 Are you from the rugby ?
p250_102 Had I heard ?
p250_103 It is an old family habit
p250_104 The allegations were still under investigation, he added
p250_105 He was released after treatment
p250_106 We have made no final decisions
p250_107 The outsourcing deal will take effect in September
p250_108 We knew they could do it
p250_109 The vast bulk of its funds are run by Aberdeen
p250_110 They must be on commission
p250_111 He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels
p250_113 Mr Wilson has received no such request
p250_114 Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights
p250_115 It's good to have a voice
p250_116 He was prepared for this
p250_117 However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full
p250_118 The palace said the Queen was deeply saddened
p250_119 No, the equipment is extra
p250_120 It didn't come as any great surprise
p250_121 Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain
p250_123 It has been a nightmare of frustration
p250_124 Before the game we went for a pint
p250_125 I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling
p250_126 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p250_127 I understand the medical concerns
p250_128 That's not an assumption that I had made
p250_129 I have learned from him
p250_130 The situation is not easy, but we will prevail
p250_131 He thought she was amazing
p250_132 Figures are not relevant to the strategy
p250_133 This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service
p250_134 It isn't a happy memory
p250_135 We have a team to reach the final
p250_136 Failure is not an option
p250_137 She's got to say something
p250_138 He is particularly happy with the size of the gallery
p250_139 This is a frightening development
p250_140 It is the latter which has prompted the warning
p250_141 That first victory made a huge difference to my career
p250_142 That is far too high
p250_143 My life has changed a lot
p250_144 We did what we had to do
p250_146 You've got to be vigilant
p250_147 You are a gambling man
p250_148 I had decided to quit the show
p250_149 Losing in that manner is very hard to take
p250_150 It was finally agreed on Saturday
p250_151 I love the spectacle of cinema
p250_152 We will try to find someone
p250_153 She died at her home
p250_154 What happened in that game ?
p250_155 Are you going to win ?
p250_156 Was it the wife ?
p250_157 Why change it ?
p250_158 What do we want to do that for ?
p250_159 Frankly, it was worth the booking
p250_160 He was pleased with his display
p250_161 Life is still very tough for them
p250_162 It is not just about pay
p250_163 It opens the door to the Champions League
p250_164 Anyway, the job will be part-time
p250_165 It has become a way of life
p250_166 The whole industry is a shambles
p250_167 People were actually not on his side
p250_168 The defender made an impressive debut
p250_169 There's only one team in Ayrshire
p250_170 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p250_171 They have not been named
p250_172 The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms
p250_173 Yesterday Abbey National said it had injected further capital into Scottish Provident
p250_174 The abuse of elderly people was appalling
p250_175 He was asked to quit
p250_176 This action reflects a slump in bookings
p250_177 Being involved at that level is like an addiction
p250_178 I'd love to be like Peter
p250_179 You will be very welcome
p250_180 It had so much to do with output
p250_181 That would open the gates of hell
p250_182 Further growth will be funded from cash flow
p250_183 The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups
p250_184 They could not match it
p250_185 First and foremost, the game is entirely different
p250_186 But the petrol station does not get the benefit
p250_187 This championship is different from the other majors
p250_188 I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal
p250_189 It appears that it was just a genuine mistake
p250_190 The new scheme will have its own terms and conditions
p250_191 Our fans have been marvellous
p250_192 This could be an amazing attraction for Glasgow
p250_193 They need to look after themselves
p250_194 Miller was every bit as happy
p250_195 They were seriously after him
p250_196 It was a bit like having children
p250_197 Aberdeen had little to offer
p250_198 We represent a wide range of society
p250_199 He was rejected because he had retired
p250_200 We always felt we could win
p250_201 It may have been a cry for help
p250_202 This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds
p250_204 We are going through difficult times
p250_205 We've had an enjoyable adventure
p250_206 For the meantime, though, the signs are good
p250_207 You could feel the heat
p250_208 We have to be happy with a British and European record
p250_209 It was a moment of madness
p250_210 And we have the experience
p250_211 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p250_212 It gave no further details
p250_214 I won't make an official complaint
p250_215 British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US
p250_216 It was worth a photograph
p250_217 The move follows a review of the Singapore
p250_218 It carried a double message
p250_219 Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match
p250_220 This gives a financial incentive to switch
p250_221 That might help a bit
p250_222 Does the name matter ?
p250_223 how do you get it back ?
p250_224 What are you not good at ?
p250_225 I think, therefore I am ?
p250_226 Who was she ?
p250_227 Harry Potter has lost his magic
p250_228 Today we must not repeat that mistake
p250_229 It had all been arranged
p250_230 My daughter is an adult
p250_231 His third goal was superb
p250_232 It will affect their work
p250_233 Basically, they have to come up with the offer
p250_234 I am considered a teenager
p250_235 The process will start tomorrow
p250_236 It's just a normal life
p250_237 The transaction is not feasible
p250_238 I wouldn't even respond to that question
p250_239 It is good for our team
p250_240 Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement
p250_241 That you can do it
p250_242 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p250_243 A career as a doctor is on hold
p250_244 During the communist time they were very privileged
p250_245 They all made the European Ryder Cup team
p250_246 His background is firmly in venture capital
p250_247 The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions
p250_248 I have spoken to the skipper
p250_249 A small number of new jobs will also be created
p250_250 She will attend in July
p250_251 They included certain insurance policies, and his share of the house
p250_252 The most important thing is the game
p250_253 There is no timetable for completing such inquiries
p250_254 Paterson can afford to be generous
p250_255 The right decision has been made
p250_257 Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families
p250_258 Customers would then be consulted over any changes
p250_260 Employees are entitled to follow their contract to the letter
p250_261 He was good, but not that good
p250_262 At half-time he was presented to both teams
p250_263 He needed a kidney - it is as simple as that
p250_264 He is a reporter for us
p250_265 We lost our composure towards the interval, he said
p250_266 Either way, the investor retains the premium
p250_267 We've had several problems over injuries
p250_268 That was a disgraceful performance
p250_269 Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed
p250_270 It was a kind of contempt
p250_271 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p250_272 I should think so, too
p250_273 There will be widespread support on all sides
p250_274 Messages have to be reinforced
p250_275 I got a yellow card
p250_276 This is no reflection on Rangers
p250_277 We accept the new rules
p250_278 They are interior designers and architects
p250_280 I rejected the idea of a separate residence
p250_281 Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes
p250_282 We are aiming for early March
p250_283 I felt about this big
p250_284 And they were being paid ?
p250_285 was everything done to save people ?
p250_286 What was the matter for concern ?
p250_287 Do I think about them often ?
p250_288 Is it in the right place ?
p250_289 It is also very valuable
p250_290 I feel really confident in that department
p250_291 This could put pressure on UK inflation
p250_292 Companies have only recently been allowed to compete on price
p250_293 The morale of the Yugoslav army is beginning to crack
p250_294 I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight
p250_295 We shall rely on human beings
p250_296 It has the potential to be another North Sea
p250_297 We would have no control over the threshold for repayment
p250_298 He has not created a Festival resource
p250_299 Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate
p250_300 I understand the security issue
p250_301 Frankly, we should all have such problems
p250_302 It was an easy decision to come here
p250_304 He ran into immediate problems with local people and police
p250_305 Funding would come from both Scotland and Northern Ireland
p250_306 No-one wanted to run it tonight
p250_308 We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service
p250_309 She has fallen in love with Scotland, however
p250_310 You have to expect this type of thing
p250_311 Stephen will get his first cap
p250_312 However, he will have his work cut out defending his title
p250_313 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p250_314 The circumstances have changed since last year
p250_315 It's all designed to speed up the service
p250_316 I wanted to change the formula
p250_317 He will address the nation this evening
p250_318 I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh
p250_319 Motherwell have no such good fortune
p250_320 We would hope to make progress on that next year
p250_321 Again the parallel with football can be drawn
p250_322 The effect was almost magical
p250_323 And that culture is everywhere In Dublin
p250_324 Holland won by five wickets
p250_325 There's still no-one like him
p250_326 McNaughton was not so sure
p250_327 I was brought up in a mining background
p250_328 I thought his speech was a disgrace
p250_329 The takeover comes as no surprise
p250_330 Job losses were also announced
p250_331 A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election
p250_332 We believe the world has too many refugees already
p250_333 The party lasted all night
p250_334 Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school
p250_335 It was nice to finish in style
p250_336 They would now be able to look forward with confidence
p250_337 Completion of the purchase is seen by the end of the year
p250_338 And he goes with it
p250_339 SCOTLAND has shown the way
p250_340 There will be good prospects ahead
p250_341 Will have consequences for Scottish universities
p250_342 The letters are going out today
p250_343 I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record
p250_344 We will listen to any suggestion
p250_345 The Premier League has been a huge success
p250_346 He has made his base in Spain
p250_348 A Home Office spokesman said
p250_349 Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis
p250_350 That is a trend which will be encouraged
p250_351 It was tough to contain the excitement
p250_352 The pain is still acute
p250_353 Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items
p250_354 It's wonderful to have won
p250_355 Many of these properties are located in the south of England
p250_356 I'd like to take the plunge
p250_357 Finally came the moment of truth
p250_358 We have very limited capacity
p250_359 Is our children learning ?
p250_360 What form did that take ?
p250_361 Are they free ?
p250_362 Is there a waiting list ?
p250_363 In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations
p250_364 Three years ago he would have been
p250_365 It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem
p250_366 Look at the Liberal Democrats
p250_367 The Allies intend to maintain the average
p250_368 We put our bid in last night
p250_369 He had no access to the database
p250_370 We're still the only ones in the High Street
p250_371 I was delighted to accept
p250_372 They should take their mobile phones
p250_374 It's fantastic to win again
p250_375 We are really good friends
p250_376 The salary changes are long overdue
p250_377 Those people must be accountable
p250_378 She said they would appeal
p250_379 The countryside is in crisis
p250_380 There is no deal as yet
p250_381 It's as wide as a church in here
p250_382 She is obviously very disappointed
p250_383 In addition, it was in breach of natural justice
p250_384 They will fight for everything
p250_385 We will win the argument
p250_386 Is it worth it ?
p250_387 Does it matter ?
p250_388 How do you take them away ?
p250_389 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p250_390 After the match, do you ?
p250_391 The team hadn't been picked
p250_392 No other job in world football can compare to this one
p250_393 One-third of the places are already taken
p250_394 I always knew she was funny
p250_395 Everyone could see the joke
p250_396 The marshall at the turn was great
p250_397 There isn't the seriousness of other businesses
p250_398 He has earned the right to their respect
p250_399 The law would appear to be on our side
p250_400 There was a substantial explosion
p250_401 The hope is that the outcome will be equally successful
p250_402 Theatre is not a museum
p250_403 The Government yesterday announced its proposed new pension account
p250_404 It has only been rumours
p250_405 I was conceived in Aberdeen
p250_406 Rugby is a hard game
p250_407 My immune system had been depleted
p250_408 Offence to the herd was not easily overlooked
p250_409 This big issue is whether it can be enforced
p250_410 Growth will come later in the cycle
p250_411 We're not taking any risks
p250_412 Neither man has been charged
p250_413 I had a fortunate war
p250_414 The choice is strictly personal
p250_415 It's too close to call
p250_416 The breakdown was much later in her life
p250_417 It became a national network
p250_418 It is a large number
p250_419 She started to put on weight
p250_420 I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters
p250_421 I wouldn't want to miss that chance
p250_422 The BBC was a disgrace
p250_423 Russell is delighted with them
p250_424 The next few months will tell
p250_425 It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped
p250_426 The second goal was superb
p250_427 I am astonished at attack
p250_428 There is a solution, she believes
p250_429 That was the agreement with the manager
p250_430 He's had to suffer for the last six years
p250_431 His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son
p250_432 Being captain of this club is fantastic
p250_433 First Minister Donald Dewar will respond
p250_434 The compromise is entirely on the arrival at that position
p250_435 No date has been fixed for his return
p250_436 Thankfully, no-one on the bus is too badly hurt
p250_437 The trial will open today
p250_438 National Farmer's Union of Scotland president, Jim Walker, welcomed the new proposals
p250_439 I never won a penny throughout my career
p250_440 THIS is a good day for Scottish farming
p250_441 There were a lot of emotions
p250_442 We have not yet received a letter from the Irish
p250_443 However, the players should have a voice in these matters
p250_444 We know about the crisis in cattle
p250_445 Everything in golf is a balance
p250_446 Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities
p250_447 External auditors will monitor the action which is planned
p250_448 The people around me were fantastic
p250_449 That will be best for him
p250_450 And we might go back
p250_451 The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland
p250_452 The villagers were shot in the head at short range
p250_453 But you can go beyond that condition
p250_454 The removal would take place in France
p250_455 It is a tough game but we have a chance
p250_456 But we have built a platform for next season
p250_457 I think the goalkeeper should have gone
p250_458 They had learned from the lessons of the first game
p250_459 The jury is still out
p250_460 It was like someone had died
p250_461 The budget was too low for that
p250_462 Neither club is going to have much time for a decent runner-up
p250_463 Striking the deal has come as a big relief
p250_464 The damage is all inside
p250_465 Let that be their memorial
p250_466 The boys are mentally focused
p250_467 This is the stuff of live music
p250_468 It may prove to be his last involvement with the club
p250_469 The move is considered a major breakthrough
p250_471 I see no reason to have this debate at this time
p250_472 He certainly did a good job!
p250_473 Talks between directors have been underway since last month
p250_474 I am certainly thinking about retirement
p250_475 At the moment, social workers take the lead on child protection issues
p250_476 I have always believed in myself
p250_477 The chief constable has retired
p250_478 Well, he is an artist
p250_479 Her body was found about four miles from the car
p250_480 The casting of her husband was an accident
p250_481 Their coach is obviously under a lot of pressure
p250_482 That was the first time I worked with Richard
p250_483 That argument has been won
p250_484 It was a narrow escape
p250_485 And rugby fans can help
p250_486 He was certainly upbeat about his chances
p250_487 The processing plant was closed yesterday
p250_488 The Israeli military denied the claim
p250_489 He is not a dancer
p250_490 I cannot explain the grief and pain in my heart
p250_491 IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock
p250_492 These people attack the core of my beliefs
p250_493 The striker needed attention before he could resume
p250_494 I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie
p250_495 We would welcome a commercial partner or partners
p250_496 Subsidy income will not be affected
p254_001 Please call Stella
p254_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p254_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p254_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p254_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p254_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p254_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p254_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p254_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p254_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p254_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p254_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p254_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p254_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p254_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p254_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p254_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p254_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p254_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p254_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p254_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p254_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p254_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p254_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p254_025 Johnson was pretty low
p254_026 But it failed
p254_027 They may be wrong
p254_028 I am not interested in the money, it is the principle
p254_029 They should have a major rethink about the event for next year
p254_030 The appeal tribunal will give its decision at a later date
p254_031 Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed
p254_032 So if we can take anything from tonight, it will be fantastic
p254_033 It's a matter of balance
p254_034 We must provide a long-term solution to tackle this attitude
p254_035 Then, suddenly, they weren't
p254_037 They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life
p254_038 However, they continued in their pursuit of victory
p254_039 They're just different
p254_040 It was clear
p254_041 It is not for any other purpose
p254_042 The main concern is that it could interfere with air traffic
p254_043 I was scared
p254_044 However, the decision has been welcomed by Scottish Enterprise officials
p254_045 No meaningful response was issued
p254_046 That period was a struggle
p254_047 I am just going to go for it
p254_048 Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man
p254_049 This represents a tough game for us
p254_050 It's a crucial award
p254_051 We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there
p254_052 That should do it
p254_053 It's a blessing
p254_054 Is a drug dealer?
p254_055 But it might have done
p254_056 That time has passed
p254_057 The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids
p254_058 He is too weak to move
p254_059 Life is good
p254_060 It is the whole package
p254_061 This is a club on the rise
p254_062 He had no enemies
p254_063 For the meantime, though, the signs are good
p254_064 We were surprised to see the photograph
p254_065 That's the day job
p254_066 In the current outbreak, the reverse is true
p254_067 This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers
p254_068 It is not a process which can be completed overnight
p254_069 My mother is a widow
p254_070 The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine
p254_071 Jobs could go
p254_072 Four other charges were dropped
p254_073 They're appalled by that
p254_074 There was a battle there
p254_075 It's good news and long overdue
p254_076 And if he hadn't become a musician?
p254_077 Charles Kennedy had an effective outing
p254_078 They never gave up hope
p254_079 It came as a surprise because my job is to go backwards
p254_080 Painful, but only because it's true
p254_081 It's all I can do
p254_082 The company yesterday refused to comment
p254_083 Both sides have been hit by injury
p254_084 The price cuts are really exciting
p254_085 My office is bare
p254_086 Is there a new way forward?
p254_087 There was an e-mail
p254_088 Even the one she loved
p254_090 Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits
p254_091 It may well have been
p254_092 However, we will obviously keep the matter under review
p254_093 He liked to give the impression of being a hard man
p254_094 Last week, he was taken into hospital
p254_095 He seems to be pleased with the picture
p254_096 All options are open
p254_097 You will be
p254_098 Global Scotland will be held at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall
p254_099 And rugby fans can help
p254_100 Now the system is right behind us
p254_101 However, it did not end that way
p254_102 This reason is to do with the nature of the Scotland manager
p254_103 The group is due to report by the end of the year
p254_104 I love the Dome
p254_105 Scotland will have strong defences as part of the United Kingdom
p254_106 The selection process is still at a very early stage
p254_107 Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights
p254_108 However, we have not come to any conclusions
p254_109 But it was a pleasure
p254_110 He takes the job
p254_111 It was an adventure
p254_112 That all hope is never lost
p254_113 And I thought - we have to do something with this
p254_114 It was really enjoyable on Saturday
p254_115 It is normal
p254_116 I was fighting for my life, I thought
p254_117 We need to handle it
p254_118 Tony Blair's spokesman insisted the decision came from Dublin
p254_119 It's a long process
p254_120 They were behind the wheel
p254_121 The fire was above the hole
p254_122 This is a scheme that has a lot of potential
p254_123 We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail
p254_124 Mr Chisholm said the move was made on the advice of consultants
p254_125 I could see his desire for the job in his eyes
p254_126 I joined a group
p254_127 Does this mean
p254_128 Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month
p254_129 It is a job creation scheme
p254_130 It is still too early for any likely contenders to have emerged
p254_131 I'm so angry
p254_132 Child abuse is a dreadful thing
p254_133 It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation
p254_134 They keep the atmosphere in mind
p254_135 It's terrible that he has died the same way
p254_136 The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk
p254_137 It plans to return to this field
p254_138 Yesterday Mr Hague dismissed the poll
p254_139 Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general
p254_140 Nobody will know the feeling of the branches until October
p254_141 Mr Hall is believed to have a broken leg
p254_143 I was the last man to touch the ball
p254_144 Three penalties were given
p254_145 We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football
p254_146 He is severe
p254_147 It is difficult for Ali
p254_148 There is a lack of chemistry
p254_149 This is the way things should be handled
p254_150 He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative
p254_151 Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition
p254_152 It is not just about pay
p254_153 Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday
p254_154 You know the type
p254_155 The weaknesses are few
p254_156 The woman is a star who has grown to love the limelight
p254_157 I was in daily contact
p254_158 We will turn the corner
p254_159 This latter point is hugely important
p254_160 Inside, the atmosphere was quiet
p254_161 It has been a lovely family occasion
p254_162 He's a nice guy
p254_163 It has to be now
p254_164 They are not advertised
p254_165 I have got a wife to feed
p254_166 Tell it like it was?
p254_167 It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful
p254_168 Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final
p254_169 We started to struggle with each other towards the end
p254_170 Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut
p254_171 He was a crazy man
p254_172 They might be broken, but they are not defeated
p254_173 First and foremost, the game is entirely different
p254_174 However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service
p254_175 It was a great achievement to win at Wembley
p254_176 It is not either national standards or local control
p254_177 The clarity is vital
p254_178 The hotel was now for sale
p254_179 Tony had arrived
p254_180 He will need that machine
p254_181 I was totally wrong
p254_182 We did everything by the book
p254_183 We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome
p254_184 However, this idea is never developed
p254_185 I grew up listening to these people
p254_186 The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small
p254_187 Peace was won
p254_188 It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work
p254_189 I wanted to put myself on the line
p254_190 Off I went
p254_191 The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address
p254_192 Is that it?
p254_193 The conference is the first test
p254_194 On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult
p254_195 The sisters also became the top two players in the world
p254_196 I would think about the end of January, the beginning of February
p254_197 They've got three-quarters of the way
p254_198 The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster
p254_199 Today was first class
p254_200 We will give a formal response to the report in due course
p254_201 We have an election in eight days
p254_202 It's like a garage
p254_203 But I am a worried man
p254_204 This gives a financial incentive to switch
p254_205 That is an important part of our role
p254_206 It is a small part, and it's very small in the book
p254_207 We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence
p254_208 I began to pray
p254_209 A Grampian Police spokesman said
p254_210 His third goal was superb
p254_211 It's not ideal
p254_212 The FBI could become involved
p254_213 On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football
p254_214 The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument
p254_215 But I felt it was important to introduce the element of tradition
p254_216 A career as a doctor is on hold
p254_217 You have to do your research
p254_218 Saturday is gone
p254_219 We played them off the pitch
p254_220 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p254_221 Clearly, the stakes are high
p254_222 The boy is no longer with us
p254_223 The track is currently covered in snow
p254_224 They are the innocent victims
p254_225 It's so special
p254_226 Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern
p254_227 At the time, he was a living legend
p254_228 Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable
p254_229 Gerhard Schroeder was the victor
p254_230 They tried to give her advice
p254_231 And thought we would get away with it
p254_232 We were a load of rubbish
p254_233 They should come forward
p254_234 It is not the message alone
p254_235 He will make a statement on the dispute in the Commons tomorrow
p254_236 The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days
p254_237 It's a lovely, lovely film
p254_238 But it's a subtle process
p254_239 The Home Office would not release any further details about the group
p254_240 My future is in the marathon
p254_241 They are all bright and different
p254_242 Chambers said he would accept the place
p254_243 I was at the British Olympic Medical Centre, on Friday
p254_244 In short, the Scottish excess is not difficult to justify
p254_245 The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery
p254_246 He got the same story
p254_247 Washington is consumed by the crisis
p254_248 I was shocked
p254_249 He's a lovely young man
p254_250 There's the mix
p254_251 There will be widespread support on all sides
p254_252 This year I understood
p254_253 That could be in place by next year
p254_254 I was never going to play against Scotland
p254_255 It's a source of deep concern
p254_256 For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique
p254_257 However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely
p254_258 The pensioners did not want to know
p254_259 It is also very valuable
p254_260 This court has made an order which has not been observed
p254_261 The work between the musicians and the fire is very important
p254_262 He thought he had a month to cross the street
p254_263 That decision is for the British Parliament and people
p254_264 They want to shut the Scottish Office
p254_265 There is no link
p254_266 This is a question of Islam
p254_267 The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision
p254_268 He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant
p254_269 Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public
p254_270 It was an easy decision to come here
p254_271 We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians
p254_272 It depends on the internal discussions in the Ministry of Defence
p254_273 Everything will fall into place, it should be fine
p254_275 Jim Wallace, justice minister, has refused to hold an inquiry
p254_276 Sadly, the revival could not be sustained
p254_277 It's a way of life
p254_278 She has fallen in love with Scotland, however
p254_279 However, he will have his work cut out defending his title
p254_280 People have no choice
p254_281 If not, he should go home
p254_282 For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray
p254_283 There was a final revealing detail about the broadcast
p254_284 You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel
p254_285 I saw it at a ruck
p254_286 This time, for Rangers, it is certainly the latter
p254_287 What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p254_288 He will address the nation this evening
p254_289 The mood is good
p254_290 It's like a high school play
p254_291 The condition of their adoption was that they should be kept together
p254_292 This is a national crisis
p254_293 Well, he can do it
p254_294 These figures are truly awful
p254_295 That could change
p254_296 Who can predict?
p254_297 In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat
p254_298 One was a lawyer
p254_299 It is a road of death
p254_300 The plot is minimal
p254_301 The court was shown a video of the house on that day
p254_302 I did not name it
p254_303 We have waited a long time for this
p254_304 Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision
p254_305 They were fantastic
p254_306 We are a peaceful people
p254_307 Craig is a major concern for us
p254_308 The problems began a long time ago
p254_309 My body is clearly capable
p254_310 It is out there
p254_311 He said she was mad
p254_312 In the old days, it was easy
p254_313 We are in the end game
p254_314 They will certainly be visible from every house in our area
p254_315 It is a strong case
p254_316 The parents will have a great time, too
p254_317 Donald was his friend
p254_318 He was not a big name
p254_319 The police have to act to help them
p254_320 It was no secret that I wanted to sign him
p254_321 The boat was fantastic
p254_322 It's not long enough
p254_323 My first concern is for the safety of the public
p254_324 Later in the day he was forced to explain his position
p254_326 Finally, he paid for the movie
p254_327 You have to be able to deal with all age groups
p254_329 It would appear that it has not been a problem
p254_330 They haven't got a hope
p254_331 It has moved on in the last week
p254_332 I'm so pleased the show has won a prize
p254_333 Today she has been released
p254_334 The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper
p254_335 It should be a great game, though
p254_336 It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet
p254_337 It should be scrapped
p254_338 A formal announcement is expected this morning at a news conference
p254_339 It was good for us that they lost that day
p254_340 They should take their mobile phones
p254_341 It is not like working for a living
p254_342 Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance
p254_343 It is long gone
p254_344 The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police
p254_345 Tell us about it
p254_346 It's all going to clear the debt
p254_347 That is a break with tradition
p254_348 A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company
p254_349 It was very formal
p254_350 I kept going for her
p254_351 The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow
p254_352 But the real problem is the closure of the export market
p254_353 No other job in world football can compare to this one
p254_354 Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors
p254_355 We will be homeless
p254_356 New Zealand rugby is totally different
p254_357 On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options
p254_358 It is clear that we must learn the lessons from this outbreak
p254_359 His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday
p254_360 We have to be sure that the taxation system can work
p254_361 Saddam is not the only example of evil in our world
p254_362 The criteria were laid down at the beginning of the season
p254_363 There was no option
p254_364 It's now down in black and white
p254_365 Now, though, he has an incentive
p254_366 It seemed a moving and fitting tribute
p254_367 They received a reply from their own managers
p254_368 But I managed
p254_369 Five members were disciplined
p254_370 Talks are progressing
p254_371 They play together perfectly
p254_372 Yesterday the company reported a further downturn in profits
p254_373 It's a record label, not a form of music
p254_374 It became a national network
p254_375 It is a large number
p254_376 We felt at the moment, it was not possible
p254_377 Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter
p254_378 He has the edge
p254_379 Of course, we will need to strengthen the squad for Europe
p254_380 Florida is the pivotal state in the nation
p254_381 Face to face
p254_382 I am very happy with life
p254_383 I'm just enjoying every match
p254_384 The service would also make a massive impact on tourism
p254_385 Star and producer were in agreement about their opinion of the director
p254_386 Family liaison officers are now working to support the family
p254_387 We have to reduce the number of plastic bags
p254_388 They really did a great job
p254_389 At the last I found a bunker
p254_390 Yet the data is compelling
p254_391 Perhaps the time has come to put the cup in a museum
p254_392 I would have loved to play in an Old Firm
p254_393 I'm pleased about one thing
p254_394 It is also claimed that he was murdered
p254_395 Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance
p254_396 We're looking for justice
p254_397 I can lead by example
p254_398 Eriksson would have approved
p254_399 Pupils were allowed home at lunchtime
p254_400 It was a breathtaking moment
p254_401 It really is a gift to the world
p254_402 The car was just there
p254_403 It was on fire
