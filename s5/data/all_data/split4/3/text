p256_001 Please call Stella
p256_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p256_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p256_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p256_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p256_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p256_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p256_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p256_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p256_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p256_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p256_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p256_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p256_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p256_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p256_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p256_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p256_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p256_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p256_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p256_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p256_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p256_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p256_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p256_025 It's a relief that a decision has finally been made
p256_026 We have to pull together, or we will hang apart
p256_027 I have a theory
p256_028 Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed
p256_029 There's a story, too
p256_030 I was an athlete
p256_031 Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist
p256_032 They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide
p256_033 Then, suddenly, they weren't
p256_034 A web site is planned for November
p256_035 It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise
p256_036 Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night
p256_037 At this stage, we think the air campaign is enough
p256_038 They're just different
p256_039 It's a real threat
p256_040 Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack
p256_041 It had been played at festivals
p256_042 Indeed, he does
p256_043 She is believed to be in South Africa
p256_044 This film will be totally awesome
p256_045 No meaningful response was issued
p256_046 That period was a struggle
p256_047 A neighbour said
p256_048 It's a crucial award
p256_049 It is difficult for Ali
p256_050 It's a blessing
p256_051 Is a drug dealer?
p256_052 It has been a horrible, horrible time
p256_053 I would love to have him home
p256_054 No-one has appeared in court in relation to her death
p256_055 He had no enemies
p256_056 Sadly, it can't
p256_057 There would appear to be no motive for the attack
p256_058 It is unique
p256_059 It is not a process which can be completed overnight
p256_060 That's the truth
p256_061 That is very hard, alone
p256_062 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p256_063 The problems are a result of that shortfall
p256_064 And a film maker was born
p256_065 It's a matter of balance
p256_066 The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow
p256_067 George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision
p256_068 They may yet have the last laugh
p256_069 There was a battle there
p256_070 They are real
p256_071 There was a tremendous amount of anger and frustration in that music
p256_072 I am pleased with the result, as it was a possible upset
p256_073 It should be devolved
p256_074 Charles Kennedy had an effective outing
p256_075 I was as strong as a horse
p256_076 Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision
p256_077 The girls are so lucky to be alive
p256_078 IT shouldn't come as a surprise, but it does
p256_079 The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow
p256_080 It is a terrible place
p256_081 I've got the shirt
p256_082 This is the way things should be handled
p256_083 It is not long term, but I need time to recover
p256_084 It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies
p256_085 It may well have been
p256_086 I first met him last summer
p256_087 Last week, he was taken into hospital
p256_088 He seems to be pleased with the picture
p256_089 It's never too late
p256_090 It was nice
p256_091 We do not get that impression now
p256_092 The city council is a major property owner in the area
p256_093 That will come after the game on Saturday
p256_094 A council spokesman said that they could not comment on the issue
p256_095 We must look forward
p256_096 I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself
p256_097 They've got to account for it
p256_098 She told The Herald
p256_099 It was clear
p256_100 There was no rescue
p256_101 We could not get any possession
p256_102 They are now divorced
p256_103 The court heard he drove into the path of a car
p256_104 Journalists should make him
p256_105 A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury
p256_106 Get to know him
p256_107 But it was a pleasure
p256_108 We have every respect for Michelle
p256_109 But they did not even get a reply to their letter
p256_110 I didn't play well last year
p256_111 Before the game we went for a pint
p256_112 They will want to perform well
p256_113 It's not perfect
p256_114 It was the eighties
p256_115 They were behind the wheel
p256_116 This is a step backwards
p256_117 It was ugly
p256_118 It would not do any harm to reinforce the message
p256_119 I joined a group
p256_120 It is rubbish
p256_121 Who would be a referee?
p256_122 That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships
p256_123 There will be a beginning, a middle, and an end
p256_124 The whole process is a vicious circle at the moment
p256_125 We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors
p256_126 There were no grounds for his action
p256_127 Wednesday night was a difficult time for Britton
p256_128 Child abuse is a dreadful thing
p256_129 His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years
p256_130 They keep the atmosphere in mind
p256_131 Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family
p256_132 Well, you can have a tree
p256_133 Who will attend?
p256_134 Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre
p256_135 The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council
p256_136 Our intentions are real
p256_137 It is also well received
p256_138 We never said that we would walk through the third division
p256_139 Police could not say if the two incidents were connected
p256_140 It was very frightened and dirty
p256_141 We want to keep the pound
p256_142 And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life
p256_143 The way he took his second goal was brilliant
p256_144 It changed my life
p256_145 Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition
p256_146 It is not just about pay
p256_147 The home side didn't stand a chance
p256_148 I was so nervous
p256_149 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p256_150 They have not been named
p256_151 There's a sense of excess in the novel
p256_152 We should be clear about the role of government
p256_153 It was by the numbers
p256_154 She also defended the Lord Chancellor's existing powers
p256_155 We will turn the corner
p256_156 This year, this month, will be special for Torrance
p256_157 He can do no wrong
p256_158 Alex has been a huge influence on the club
p256_159 These days are long gone
p256_160 I will tell you
p256_161 A Labour insider said it was far too close to call
p256_162 It has to be now
p256_163 We have to move forward
p256_164 They are not advertised
p256_165 We knew we had the goal we wanted
p256_166 It's hard enough for a father, anyway, and I was forever grateful
p256_167 By then, however, both men were already in the US
p256_168 Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final
p256_169 The post will be unpaid
p256_170 Does that put pressure on us?
p256_171 Waiting times for these services are too long
p256_172 It is too much for me
p256_173 We've made a couple of albums
p256_174 It is not either national standards or local control
p256_175 If that's the case, he will struggle
p256_176 The hotel was now for sale
p256_177 The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate
p256_178 They took a risk
p256_179 I have the first six months of next season to prove myself
p256_180 There is no point in looking any further
p256_181 Nothing is safe
p256_182 They will run a mile
p256_183 Four policemen were wounded
p256_184 They receive a high profile in the media
p256_185 We did everything by the book
p256_186 They need to look after themselves
p256_187 I saw military vehicles in the distance
p256_188 My main concern is that public health is not put at risk
p256_189 It is a terrible loss
p256_190 Suddenly, the rugby world had changed
p256_191 If the director is with you
p256_192 I am totally surprised
p256_193 I grew up listening to these people
p256_194 The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small
p256_195 Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament
p256_196 It is a case of taking a risk
p256_197 I wanted to put myself on the line
p256_198 It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council
p256_199 People acted too quickly
p256_200 I have a cold
p256_201 The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions
p256_202 Tommy is not a problem
p256_203 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p256_204 They've got three-quarters of the way
p256_205 But she might be
p256_206 It was worth a photograph
p256_207 After that time, the market itself will set the prices
p256_208 It's like a garage
p256_209 But I am a worried man
p256_210 HARRY Potter has lost his magic
p256_211 She should not be blamed
p256_212 It had all been arranged
p256_213 The second is the reaction of the Hibs fans
p256_214 The FBI could become involved
p256_215 A final decision will be taken by First Minister Donald Dewar
p256_216 The workers do not want to read about their futures in newspapers
p256_217 On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football
p256_218 The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo
p256_219 We've got the bronze
p256_220 It's so special
p256_221 We will be victorious
p256_222 He seemed to lose his focus
p256_223 At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher
p256_224 If it doesn't, it doesn't
p256_225 I am immensely sad
p256_226 It is a gamble
p256_227 My neighbours are horrified
p256_228 The track is currently covered in snow
p256_229 I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision
p256_230 They are the innocent victims
p256_231 My wife and family are the support system
p256_232 The body follows the mind
p256_233 It is set in Paris
p256_234 It's quite nice
p256_235 It's a lovely, lovely film
p256_236 A succession of managers in the opera company resigned
p256_237 However, he is a coach, and he remains a coach at heart
p256_238 The Home Office would not release any further details about the group
p256_239 He was good, but not that good
p256_240 He claimed the government had lost the plot
p256_241 Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order
p256_242 It would appear that it has not been a problem
p256_243 It is hard won
p256_244 He says that he is no different from any other man
p256_245 The scene is about this?
p256_246 Some families have even requested to leave the city
p256_247 We will need to study the report before any decision is taken
p256_248 In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win
p256_249 I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal
p256_250 It was a hit
p256_251 There will be widespread support on all sides
p256_252 Her presence was almost everywhere
p256_253 I was never going to play against Scotland
p256_254 At the end of the day, one has to be careful
p256_255 That was a bonus, but it was not the main objective
p256_256 The bottom line is that we had to get a win
p256_257 Chelsea was a great club
p256_258 That's what made the difference and set the pattern of the match
p256_259 One MP said he feared the job losses were only the beginning
p256_260 It is a mark of respect from the inmates
p256_261 Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London
p256_262 I am very angry
p256_263 The pensioners did not want to know
p256_264 I have never been a close friend of Jim McLean
p256_265 He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky
p256_266 Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention
p256_267 That's the only thing I will say
p256_268 It looks as though he will be right
p256_269 Of course, that is not the whole story
p256_270 He has not created a Festival resource
p256_271 Frankly, we should all have such problems
p256_272 It was an easy decision to come here
p256_273 And Michael was just great
p256_274 She has every confidence in his performance of his duties
p256_275 The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline
p256_276 I am an estate agent
p256_277 They were on holiday in Egypt
p256_278 In fact, he was talking about the survival business
p256_279 It happens from time to time
p256_280 For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray
p256_281 But I've won both ways
p256_282 I saw it at a ruck
p256_283 The attacker died in the crash
p256_284 The Government is keen to promote the growth of friendly societies
p256_285 It's like a high school play
p256_286 Scotland were beaten again
p256_287 It's very safe
p256_288 He was obviously very genuine
p256_289 She said she could not believe that they had run away
p256_290 It shows a contempt by him for the industry
p256_291 He wrote the letter two days before he died
p256_292 The results are sometimes contentious
p256_293 The songs are just so good
p256_294 Who can predict?
p256_295 They are a total disgrace to the loyalist cause
p256_296 It became a book by itself
p256_297 The home was now under new management
p256_298 I thought it was my only chance
p256_300 One was a lawyer
p256_301 Our task is to complete the picture
p256_302 The party lasted all night
p256_303 It's so awful
p256_304 It's just not funny!
p256_305 It is no country for a man or woman of letters
p256_306 Funding for the science centre has come from a number of sources
p256_307 It is no surprise
p256_308 Let's hope it's an investment in the future
p256_309 O Neill is caught between a rock and a hard place
p256_310 We have waited a long time for this
p256_311 This is the culture change in medicine
p256_312 and that another interested body should have an option to buy
p256_313 This wasn't the way it was supposed to be
p256_314 It is all credit to them today
p256_315 They were fantastic
p256_316 There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh
p256_317 She is very distinctive
p256_318 It's not even finished
p256_319 Henman has been warned
p256_320 It should be equal
p257_001 Please call Stella
p257_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p257_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p257_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p257_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p257_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p257_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p257_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p257_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p257_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p257_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p257_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p257_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p257_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p257_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p257_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p257_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p257_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p257_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p257_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p257_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases

p257_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p257_025 We have to pull together, or we will hang apart
p257_026 Is this accurate?
p257_027 They should have a major rethink about the event for next year
p257_028 Because we do not need it
p257_029 Life was like a timetable
p257_030 Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night
p257_031 It was clear
p257_032 Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons
p257_033 I came to complete
p257_034 President Bush is at war
p257_035 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p257_036 I was scared
p257_037 It was ugly
p257_038 It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside
p257_039 It's easy to talk about these things in the abstract
p257_040 The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough
p257_041 A neighbour said
p257_042 We need to chat
p257_043 The boy is no longer with us
p257_044 I hate the word
p257_045 That should do it
p257_046 It's a blessing
p257_047 The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids
p257_048 As she explains
p257_049 Yesterday, he had a chilling warning for the game in Scotland
p257_050 He had no enemies
p257_051 I got a great response from the players, as I had expected
p257_052 But the law is very clear on this
p257_053 For the meantime, though, the signs are good
p257_054 We were surprised to see the photograph
p257_055 Next league matches Celtic
p257_056 It's very odd
p257_057 The story was first reported in the Spectator magazine
p257_058 It is not great art
p257_059 George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision
p257_060 There was a battle there
p257_061 Scotland had great assets
p257_062 There will be tough opponents to this report
p257_063 Have a look at our accounts
p257_064 Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p257_065 There is an element of racism in Scotland
p257_066 I was just trying to win the golf tournament
p257_067 It's all I can do
p257_068 There could be a way back
p257_069 They do not work for Glasgow City Council
p257_070 The price cuts are really exciting
p257_071 Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision
p257_072 I had my suspicions
p257_073 She died in hospital two hours later
p257_074 It was chaotic
p257_075 Is there a new way forward?
p257_076 I've not thought about it
p257_077 People must remain vigilant
p257_078 Mr Irvine said Mr Rafferty was now in good spirits
p257_079 It is not long term, but I need time to recover
p257_080 It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet
p257_081 It may well have been
p257_082 He liked to give the impression of being a hard man
p257_083 He seems to be pleased with the picture
p257_084 Obviously, we were pretty close in a couple of games
p257_085 I, in the meantime, had been far from chilling
p257_086 It's never too late
p257_087 Florida is the pivotal state in the nation
p257_088 Downing Street will make the second appointment in the Scotland Office today
p257_089 Yesterday, he continued to keep a low profile
p257_090 Today I couldn't run on it
p257_091 We must look forward
p257_092 It is an old family habit
p257_093 He was possessed
p257_094 She told The Herald
p257_095 Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack
p257_096 The peace process will be buried!
p257_097 The oil companies would be asked to contribute
p257_098 They are now divorced
p257_099 They were under a lot of pressure from the other clubs
p257_100 It was mayhem
p257_101 However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full
p257_102 Tomorrow he will make a keynote speech on Europe
p257_103 We have every respect for Michelle
p257_104 That time is not now, however
p257_105 I didn't play well last year
p257_106 For these people, the ruling is very welcome
p257_107 They will want to perform well
p257_108 They had to be cut from the wreckage
p257_109 I did not think about the Ryder Cup
p257_110 It is normal
p257_111 I was fighting for my life, I thought
p257_112 I don't have many friends
p257_113 It's a shame
p257_114 It was the eighties
p257_115 We do not expect any surplus
p257_116 Naturally, it was not difficult to find support for these proposals
p257_117 It's not a new concept in jazz
p257_118 We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail
p257_119 I'm delighted about that
p257_120 Does this mean
p257_121 This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election
p257_122 He did his job
p257_123 You can spend money on housing
p257_124 That's all right then
p257_125 I was furious
p257_126 It has removed a bit of guilt
p257_127 His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years
p257_128 It's terrible that he has died the same way
p257_129 So the European elections are extremely important
p257_130 Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince
p257_131 Who will attend?
p257_132 The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council
p257_133 The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk
p257_134 I am now unemployed
p257_135 Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland
p257_136 They made such decisions in London
p257_137 Our intentions are real
p257_138 It is also well received
p257_139 What will happen then?
p257_140 It's not true
p257_141 I feel very grateful with everything
p257_142 We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties
p257_143 Nobody in the world can get away from him
p257_144 He sees a difference in the style of the two teams
p257_145 We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football
p257_146 There is a lack of chemistry
p257_147 That could mean the difference between life and death in action
p257_148 It is like a football team
p257_149 That group reported just before Christmas
p257_150 He will emerge as a world leader
p257_151 It opens the door to the Champions League
p257_152 They did very well
p257_153 It became a book by itself
p257_154 But he stressed that the partnership is not a construction company
p257_155 The weather forecast isn't good
p257_156 There's a sense of excess in the novel
p257_157 For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon
p257_158 There's a pause
p257_159 He can do no wrong
p257_160 It was so new, so exciting
p257_161 I've learned from my mistakes
p257_162 A Labour insider said it was far too close to call
p257_163 I've put my own money into this project
p257_164 However, the French government has a major dilemma on its hands
p257_165 I lost my head
p257_166 You are not going in blind
p257_167 Yet it is unlikely to be either full, or final
p257_168 As far as we were concerned the deal with Kennedy was dead
p257_169 And I was happy for the happiness of my brothers
p257_170 My life has been destroyed
p257_171 There was no hint of scandal
p257_172 Treatment is not an issue with these people
p257_173 I feel like my game has come a long way
p257_174 We wanted it left for a wee while
p257_175 However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service
p257_176 It's quite a routine
p257_177 There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging
p257_178 In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat
p257_179 Everyone can be bought
p257_180 It is minute
p257_181 They need to look after themselves
p257_182 What has caused the demise of singing?
p257_183 One was a lawyer
p257_184 My main concern is that public health is not put at risk
p257_185 It was an odd affair, in many respects
p257_186 Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender
p257_187 Saturday is gone
p257_188 I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react
p257_189 Last night was a key episode
p257_190 We must keep our feet on the ground
p257_191 The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small
p257_192 Off I went
p257_193 There would appear to be no motive for the attack
p257_194 He has a lot of experience as captain in his career
p257_195 Ferguson should take note
p257_196 The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster
p257_197 It's just awful
p257_198 We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead
p257_199 IT S all in the hair
p257_200 We have an election in eight days
p257_201 But I am a worried man
p257_202 This gives a financial incentive to switch
p257_203 Saddam Hussein is a devil
p257_204 He knows a lot
p257_205 He is slightly confused
p257_206 Her home is perhaps a couple of miles from the town centre
p257_207 We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence
p257_208 I am delighted for Simon
p257_209 It had all been arranged
p257_210 A Grampian Police spokesman said
p257_211 We have got to get it right
p257_212 However, Dundee deserved to win this game
p257_213 I might come back
p257_214 His death was a tragic accident
p257_215 It's just a place to open it
p257_216 He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda
p257_217 Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E
p257_218 William Hague delighted his party
p257_219 At the top of the structure will remain the post of headteacher
p257_220 We played them off the pitch
p257_221 She really suffered for her art
p257_222 He demanded to speak to the boss
p257_223 Jim Wallace, the justice minister, acknowledged that prisoner numbers were a concern
p257_224 Her condition was yesterday described as critical, but stable
p257_225 I think he's the favourite, no question
p257_226 Broke the birdie record
p257_227 They had no children
p257_228 It is set in Paris
p257_229 Well, they were the unlucky ones
p257_230 The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days
p257_231 On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence
p257_232 John Prescott, the deputy prime minister, will fly to the summit tomorrow
p257_233 But it's a subtle process
p257_234 The Home Office would not release any further details about the group
p257_235 My future is in the marathon
p257_236 Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order
p257_237 A change in that position would require a decision by the council
p257_238 They may yet have the last laugh
p257_239 You can feel at home in China
p257_240 It is a policy which has the full support of the minister
p257_241 I should think so, too
p257_242 We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre
p257_243 I didn't need to watch it on the video
p257_244 He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic
p257_245 I will not allow the destruction of the Scottish fishing industry
p257_246 We need to move away from the culture of long hours
p257_247 He said he intended to push for a judicial review
p257_248 He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather
p257_249 I watched a game
p257_250 They are interior designers and architects
p257_251 There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement
p257_252 they fail to engage
p257_253 It is a mark of respect from the inmates
p257_254 I would have the hammer in the crowd
p257_255 He thought he had a month to cross the street
p257_256 He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky
p257_257 Blood samples were taken
p257_258 He claimed his insurance company contested the damages, not the restaurant
p257_259 It's very nice
p257_260 Frankly, we should all have such problems
p257_261 Similar measures are expected in England and Wales
p257_262 We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians
p257_263 And Michael was just great
p257_264 We're in shock
p257_265 Everything will fall into place, it should be fine
p257_266 Our objective is to tackle poverty
p257_267 One knows the feeling
p257_268 She has fallen in love with Scotland, however
p257_269 She looked so young
p257_270 It was a privilege to work for him
p257_271 For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray
p257_272 He looked very sharp
p257_273 You've got to have both sides
p257_274 Who did the recruiting?
p257_275 Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people
p257_276 Well, he can do it
p257_277 It shows a contempt by him for the industry
p257_278 It is a vote of confidence in the skills in Scotland
p257_279 He added that public transport improvements must also be maintained
p257_280 The results are sometimes contentious
p257_281 He should have won
p257_282 A new school will be built
p257_283 Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen
p257_284 That might be a punishment but it would also punish the patients
p257_285 What has altered?
p257_286 The home was now under new management
p257_287 Graeme was prepared
p257_288 I thought it was my only chance
p257_289 However, the snow was welcomed by some
p257_290 It just came into my head that day
p257_291 They are wrong
p257_292 Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday
p257_293 It's just not funny!
p257_294 I am very happy to be here
p257_295 The plot is minimal
p257_296 It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing
p257_297 A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe
p257_298 This is the culture change in medicine
p257_299 and that another interested body should have an option to buy
p257_300 They were fantastic
p257_301 I never thought it would take this long
p257_302 In fact, they have the opposite effect
p257_303 They wanted the club to make money
p257_304 Kids are terrible
p257_305 Henman has been warned
p257_306 It should be equal
p257_307 Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure
p257_308 The home team had an amazing start
p257_309 It is out there
p257_310 They had a confession
p257_311 Davis is very supportive, as a director
p257_312 We are in the end game
p257_313 I came into this world with nothing
p257_314 But no such amendment has been brought before the Scottish Parliament
p257_315 I am so upset
p257_316 The boat was fantastic
p257_317 I saw some good things
p257_318 Finally, he paid for the movie
p257_319 You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel
p257_320 In addition, certain areas are closed at certain times
p257_321 Three years ago he would have been
p257_322 You feel the pride
p257_323 It is so unfair
p257_324 The announcement was made after inquiries from a national newspaper
p257_325 Indeed, it was magical
p257_326 I've got no secret
p257_327 Look at the witnesses
p257_328 I'm very lucky
p257_329 We must do something
p257_330 He says that he is no different from any other man
p257_331 Alex Ferguson is the same
p257_332 I was pleased to be back on the podium in Brazil
p257_333 Like his acting, it was an accident
p257_334 It is not like working for a living
p257_335 It is long gone
p257_336 The man was obviously desperate to get away from the police
p257_337 Tell us about it
p257_338 The salary changes are long overdue
p257_339 He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal
p257_340 It was very formal
p257_341 The pressure is on Celtic in the main
p257_342 Tyson is overwhelmed
p257_343 We are delighted at the response from potential employers
p257_344 I wanted to go out on a high
p257_345 Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors
p257_346 I felt really good until Friday
p257_347 His legal adviser was also not in court yesterday
p257_348 He could face a jail sentence
p257_349 For one veteran, the memories remain vivid
p257_350 I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself
p257_351 I am not willing to say anything about any couple
p257_352 Then followed a bout of flu
p257_353 There is no signature
p257_354 It's a long process
p257_355 It is a large number
p257_356 He knew his job inside out
p257_357 I wouldn't want to miss that chance
p257_358 Whether his stance is shared by the incoming manager is another matter
p257_359 It does not even have a staff shortage
p257_360 I haven't had a kick at a Celtic player for a while
p257_361 He has the edge
p257_362 He denied the charge
p257_363 There were no casualties
p257_364 Since then, he has played no active part in the company
p257_365 YOU thought it was a headache
p257_366 Family liaison officers are now working to support the family
p257_367 A council spokesman said it had been a constructive meeting
p257_368 They really did a great job
p257_369 There is a solution, she believes
p257_370 However, it's good to turn the page
p257_371 This year I understood
p257_372 I'm pleased about one thing
p257_373 It is unusual
p257_374 It is also claimed that he was murdered
p257_375 It is likely the rest of the market will follow suit
p257_376 I can lead by example
p257_377 Well, it did last time, he was reminded
p257_378 They are good
p257_379 He repeated his call for an inquiry into the police response
p257_380 My husband was born in Zimbabwe
p257_381 So, in a sense, it was a government subsidy
p257_382 It was on fire
p257_383 The orchestra was already increasing the scope of its ambitions
p257_384 I never won a penny throughout my career
p257_385 Emotions were complex
p257_386 He's already made history
p257_387 So I did
p257_388 You ask the question
p257_389 Whether the High Court will interfere with the sentence is another matter
p257_390 There was no trouble
p257_391 This is a huge confidence boost
p257_392 Not because they want to sing about something
p257_393 It is not a standing army
p257_394 We haven't had any adverse reaction to the project
p257_395 I believe the gap is nearly there
p257_396 You wanted the evidence
p257_397 Our numbers are small
p257_398 I was very young
p257_399 We have just got to keep his feet on the ground
p257_400 I am the Son of Sam
p257_401 She is superb
p257_402 Today, he is in the same position as four years ago
p257_403 It doesn't always work that way
p257_404 It is simple, but profound
p257_405 No preference emerged
p257_406 But they are still unlikely to be involved in combat
p257_407 I've invented a village in East Lothian
p257_408 She has reached the top of her profession
p257_409 It goes with the job
p257_410 The Edinburgh audience was able to understand the dialogue
p257_411 Now, however, it has undergone a dramatic decline
p257_412 I recommend a tour
p257_413 We are delighted with this outcome
p257_414 I have so much respect for him
p257_415 We shall be victorious
p257_416 Rather than answer, she resigned
p257_417 War is not the action
p257_418 They said so that I would look good in uniform
p257_419 It's not about defining styles
p257_420 One must hope not!
p257_421 It is marvellous
p257_422 But it may take some time to confirm the findings
p257_423 They should not be blamed for it
p257_424 Charlie Gordon, leader of the council, dismissed the suggestion
p257_425 It is bizarre
p257_426 Mary Archer is almost too clever
p257_427 I was just overwhelmed
p257_428 It had been in place since last July
p257_429 It's a miracle
p257_430 The first minister is obviously concerned to hear about this incident
p257_431 That was the first time I worked with Richard
p257_432 They will form a tribute
p257_433 The whole region is in shock
p257_434 The bill would be massive
p258_001 Please call Stella
p258_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p258_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p258_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p258_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p258_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p258_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p258_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p258_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p258_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p258_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p258_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p258_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p258_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p258_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p258_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p258_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p258_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p258_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p258_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p258_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p258_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p258_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p258_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p258_025 Johnson was pretty low
p258_026 It's nice to hear
p258_027 People come into the Borders for the beauty of the background
p258_028 They should be so lucky
p258_029 Because it's a waste of time for both sides
p258_030 However, the following year the cancer returned
p258_031 Because we do not need it
p258_032 He took me on a tour of the wards
p258_033 They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide
p258_034 I'd like to continue that record
p258_035 It was clear
p258_036 It is not for any other purpose
p258_037 President Bush is at war
p258_038 I was scared
p258_039 It will come all right
p258_040 It is great to have this beautiful new site in wonderful countryside
p258_041 The judge said
p258_042 We need to chat
p258_043 It's a blessing
p258_044 As she explains
p258_045 She looked so young
p258_046 He looks like an Afghan
p258_047 It is the whole package
p258_048 I got a great response from the players, as I had expected
p258_049 We were surprised to see the photograph
p258_050 That's the day job
p258_051 We have not given up hope
p258_052 You must have a government and a good civil service
p258_053 That is very hard, alone
p258_054 It's that kind of place
p258_055 Until recently, she worked as a recruitment consultant in London
p258_056 And if he hadn't become a musician?
p258_057 He was popular
p258_058 It should be devolved
p258_059 We welcome the decision of Mr Byers
p258_060 Try to save us
p258_061 He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture
p258_062 Sounds like The Sixth Sense?
p258_063 There is an element of racism in Scotland
p258_064 That was the easy election
p258_065 It's all I can do
p258_066 The price cuts are really exciting
p258_067 Chris Smith, the culture secretary, said he was satisfied with the decision
p258_068 The girls are so lucky to be alive
p258_069 The First Minister is scheduled to be elected by the Parliament tomorrow
p258_070 I am a soldier, a soldier, a soldier
p258_071 He got the same story
p258_072 This is the way things should be handled
p258_073 It is not long term, but I need time to recover
p258_074 It is a matter of the utmost concern to the Allies
p258_075 However, we will obviously keep the matter under review
p258_076 I first met him last summer
p258_077 Last week, he was taken into hospital
p258_078 Nothing is yet confirmed
p258_079 New Zealand rugby is totally different
p258_080 We have other options
p258_081 Every time I play I do not understand their reaction
p258_082 The city council is a major property owner in the area
p258_083 Today I couldn't run on it
p258_084 They are different types
p258_085 It is a simple equation
p258_086 Until you hit the big games
p258_087 Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack
p258_088 There was no rescue
p258_089 She's got to say something
p258_090 The selection process is still at a very early stage
p258_091 Children should be given the same amount of rights as adults
p258_092 Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons
p258_093 Journalists should make him
p258_094 But it was a pleasure
p258_095 We're not seeing an image of the person, he said
p258_096 Oil embargo endorsed
p258_097 It is a good lifestyle
p258_098 Before the game we went for a pint
p258_099 Now, though, he believes that the new formation has helped his form
p258_100 It's not perfect
p258_101 They had to be cut from the wreckage
p258_102 She has been shot
p258_103 He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald
p258_104 According to the criteria, he is qualified for Scotland
p258_105 We do not expect any surplus
p258_106 He said he was impressed by the set-up at Celtic
p258_107 It is so sad
p258_108 We have to look at everything before we make any final decision
p258_109 We are determined to continue on this mission and we will prevail
p258_110 This film will be totally awesome
p258_111 Maybe this battle has been
p258_112 Until the weekend he was minister for social justice
p258_113 I joined a group
p258_114 This is the end of a chapter, and it is very sad
p258_115 Who would have?
p258_116 It is a delight on every level
p258_117 You can spend money on housing
p258_118 Here, again, they were denied a voice
p258_119 Overall, it was a promising day for the Scots
p258_120 There will be no shortage of quality applicants
p258_121 I could see his desire for the job in his eyes
p258_122 It has removed a bit of guilt
p258_123 She does not want to speak
p258_124 It's terrible that he has died the same way
p258_125 So the European elections are extremely important
p258_126 Our thoughts are with the relatives of the family
p258_127 Buckingham Palace said the appointment was a matter for the prince
p258_128 Wish I could be there on Sunday in person but I can't
p258_129 The move has provoked a mixed response
p258_130 The role was perfect for Russell
p258_131 It plans to return to this field
p258_132 They made such decisions in London
p258_133 Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general
p258_134 My conscience is not clear
p258_135 I am totally devoted to this job

p258_137 If people are genuine, then the problem is not Osama bin Laden
p258_138 We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football
p258_139 Is that Titanic?
p258_140 He sets the nature of his Parliament in a simple, realistic context
p258_141 Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday
p258_142 It opens the door to the Champions League
p258_143 You know the type
p258_144 The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough
p258_145 The FBI could become involved
p258_146 The weather forecast isn't good
p258_147 She had gone to the Catholic school
p258_148 My Dad is a hero
p258_149 The weather affected the other two games in Fife
p258_150 Neither side can win this war
p258_151 Was this element always there?
p258_152 These days are long gone
p258_153 I've put my own money into this project
p258_154 They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today
p258_155 Councillors are expected to take a decision within the next few weeks
p258_156 They say that vital evidence was not heard in court
p258_157 Military action is the only option we have on the table today
p258_158 We have to move forward
p258_159 Local managers are already involved in talks with potential investors
p258_160 We try to keep it right
p258_161 It's that sort of night
p258_162 I lost my head
p258_163 It is not too late to get on board
p258_164 Last weekend in Germany, he missed the cut
p258_165 That will do for me
p258_166 They thought they had found a home
p258_167 I always felt they played for me
p258_168 Mr Blunkett said he was deeply concerned by the ruling
p258_169 First and foremost, the game is entirely different
p258_170 IT S the real thing, for sure
p258_171 However, the figures were disputed by the Scottish Prison Service
p258_172 If that's the case, he will struggle
p258_173 It should be easy
p258_174 There is no evidence of a Little Scotland emerging
p258_175 I drove the ball well
p258_176 Almost the day after the election, the battle lines were drawn
p258_177 I've been there
p258_178 They will run a mile
p258_179 Four policemen were wounded
p258_180 They receive a high profile in the media
p258_181 We did everything by the book
p258_182 The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday
p258_183 He was adamant that he was still ahead on everything that matters
p258_184 We want to help them through it
p258_185 It is a terrible loss
p258_186 We talk about Mr Michael Johnson, and he is awesome
p258_187 The procedure is the same in all cases
p258_188 If the director is with you
p258_189 It's very difficult to find a buyer
p258_190 I grew up listening to these people
p258_191 The spokeswoman said the flat in London was very small
p258_192 It's a commission, and it's for work, a year's work
p258_193 The modern approach will also be reflected in the terms of address
p258_194 It's the same old story
p258_195 It was served by sheriff officers, not by the council
p258_196 Is that success?
p258_197 Ferguson should take note
p258_198 They've got three-quarters of the way
p258_199 But she might be
p258_200 A deadline is still essential
p258_201 We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead
p258_202 It was worth a photograph
p258_203 It's a mixture of everything
p258_204 After that time, the market itself will set the prices
p258_205 We have an election in eight days
p258_206 The aim is to have the reports online by this autumn
p258_207 Feel the heat?
p258_208 He is slightly confused
p258_209 She should not be blamed
p258_210 Tenants will be unable to defend themselves
p258_211 It had all been arranged
p258_212 A Grampian Police spokesman said
p258_213 His third goal was superb
p258_214 It's not ideal
p258_215 We want to keep the pound
p258_216 I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery
p258_217 He seemed to lose his focus
p258_218 I might come back
p258_219 His death was a tragic accident
p258_220 On a technical level, they were not afraid to play good football
p258_221 He said that healthy eating was high on the council agenda
p258_222 Friends of the Earth Scotland last night welcomed the announcement
p258_223 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p258_224 It's so special
p258_225 The loss of a company to the industry is a blow
p258_226 What was the main difference?
p258_227 It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come
p258_228 I am very sorry that Alastair Campbell has taken this decision
p258_229 They are the innocent victims
p258_230 My wife and family are the support system
p258_231 Jim Leighton will play in the Scottish Cup final
p258_232 They tried to give her advice
p258_233 They had no children
p258_234 We are in the hat
p258_235 They should come forward
p258_236 Well, they were the unlucky ones
p258_237 It's quite nice
p258_238 Hospitals are for the ill
p258_239 The problem in Norway is outside the National
p258_240 Attendance at the project is a condition of a probation order
p258_241 They are all bright and different
p258_242 It is hard won
p258_243 It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet
p258_244 Manager Bobby Williamson has no injury worries
p258_245 You can feel at home in China
p258_246 It is a policy which has the full support of the minister
p258_247 It's a record label, not a form of music
p258_248 I was shocked
p258_249 I should think so, too
p258_250 We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre
p258_251 I didn't need to watch it on the video
p258_252 He has already received the Freedom of Aberdeen
p258_253 Her presence was almost everywhere
p258_254 We need to move away from the culture of long hours
p258_255 Scotland has competed in its own right in cycling
p258_256 He was my big brother, my father, my grandfather
p258_257 They are interior designers and architects
p258_258 Chelsea was a great club
p258_259 It will now relate to all public bodies in Scotland
p258_260 I was in jail for five years
p258_261 I am very angry
p258_262 They must play for each other
p258_263 Today we can say that a new era has begun
p258_264 It is also very valuable
p258_265 He thought he had a month to cross the street
p258_266 It's all change on the music scene in Manchester
p258_267 I saw one body
p258_268 That's the only thing I will say
p258_269 Their findings are published in the journal, Injury Prevention
p258_270 The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision
p258_271 Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate
p258_272 Our dispute is with the company, not the travelling public
p258_273 Similar measures are expected in England and Wales
p258_274 It is the same in Sweden
p258_275 Lottery money was intended to be used for good causes
p258_276 Our objective is to tackle poverty
p258_277 They were all in a stable condition last night
p258_278 It's a way of life
p258_279 The record companies have gone through the floor
p258_280 He has already suffered a good deal of unwanted attention
p258_281 He has a wealth of experience
p258_282 It's so awful
p258_283 For the moment, that is the result of the X-ray
p258_284 I intended to look for another club on loan
p258_285 Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished
p258_286 This is a national crisis
p258_287 The death toll included five children
p258_288 He was obviously very genuine
p258_289 It shows a contempt by him for the industry
p258_290 It was deployed in the Gulf War
p258_291 The results are sometimes contentious
p258_292 These figures are truly awful
p258_293 It's an issue that will have to be tackled
p258_294 Sunday's game was not a trial
p258_295 A new school will be built
p258_296 The move was welcomed by the Roman Catholic Church in Scotland
p258_297 Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board
p258_298 The home was now under new management
p258_299 Graeme was prepared
p258_300 In spite of recent advances, the language is still under threat
p258_301 Nothing is safe
p258_302 One was a lawyer
p258_303 A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election
p258_304 The confidence is low, but it is a difficult thing to understand
p258_305 Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school
p258_306 This is a war over our home
p258_307 In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge
p258_308 Alex Smith has been a massive influence on my career as well
p258_309 It wasn't just the character and energy of the playing
p258_310 It's certainly different
p258_311 The court was shown a video of the house on that day
p258_312 He will go a long way
p258_313 We want to play at the worlds
p258_314 Scotland were beaten again
p258_315 They were fantastic
p258_316 There is no other solution to congestion in Edinburgh
p258_317 Kids are terrible
p258_318 It should be equal
p258_319 The problems began a long time ago
p258_320 My body is clearly capable
p258_321 Referees are easy targets
p258_322 He said she was mad
p258_323 It is a private matter between the firm and our staff
p258_324 Davis is very supportive, as a director
p258_325 However, the groups denied the claims
p258_326 There was some merit in that
p258_327 I came into this world with nothing
p258_328 It is a strong case
p258_329 They will certainly be visible from every house in our area
p258_330 Off with their heads
p258_331 I am so upset
p258_332 I'd like to take the plunge
p258_333 Robert is a special talent
p258_334 Finally, he paid for the movie
p258_335 There was no option
p258_336 They haven't got a hope
p258_337 He did a good job
p258_338 I'm so pleased the show has won a prize
p258_339 It was so new, so exciting
p258_340 They made clear that they are not interested in Government assistance
p258_341 Indeed, it was magical
p258_342 I've got no secret
p258_343 There's no place to hide
p258_344 Tiger is the exception
p258_345 Nobody else was with me
p258_346 That is the very reason why it was so vital
p258_347 The composer will conduct
p258_348 His contract was then not renewed
p258_349 I got a yellow card
p258_350 It is long gone
p258_351 Eight months later, he was dead
p258_352 A report is the first step in a criminal case in India
p258_353 I saw some good things
p258_354 The salary changes are long overdue
p258_355 He met Mr Davies to establish the scale of the scandal
p258_356 A spokeswoman for Edinburgh City Council confirmed its support for the company
p258_357 It was very formal
p258_358 The Scottish Parliament should set an example for Westminster to follow
p258_359 But the real problem is the closure of the export market
p258_360 No other job in world football can compare to this one
p258_361 Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors
p258_362 We will be homeless
p258_363 That would help
p258_364 It was fit for royalty
p258_365 Mr Anderson was not acting in the course of his employment
p258_366 It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives
p258_367 He is very concerned about his fitness as a footballer
p258_368 It's not pretty, but it's effective
p258_369 I feel pretty good
p258_370 I am a star
p258_371 He could make it
p258_372 I thought he was my friend
p258_373 He could face a jail sentence
p258_374 The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland
p258_375 It took about an hour for the gas to clear
p258_376 We knew we had the goal we wanted
p258_377 Well, the big day has arrived
p258_378 I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role
p258_379 Not because they want to sing about something
p258_380 Colour was at the core of his life
p258_381 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p258_382 It was a cry for help
p258_383 Something is wrong
p258_384 It is obvious that we are engaged in a war
p258_385 It is a temptation which should be resisted
p258_386 That team is due to be announced this morning
p258_387 That's the name of the game, though
p258_388 However, it is understood that offers of further payments are unlikely
p258_389 I was so nervous
p258_390 YOU thought it was a headache
p258_391 There is a solution, she believes
p258_392 However, it's good to turn the page
p258_393 One day, he threw the baby against a wall
p258_394 This year I understood
p258_395 Public confidence was undermined by that terrible tragedy
p258_396 I suspect the latter
p258_397 These guys are looking for business
p258_398 He is on the wrong side
p258_399 It was a breathtaking moment
p258_400 The car was just there
p258_401 But, in fact, the reverse is true
p258_402 It is full-scale
p258_403 My house was shaking at the time
p258_404 Then , he laughs
p258_405 They are not left wing
p258_406 A new leader is unlikely to be chosen before September
p258_407 We have not yet received a letter from the Irish
p258_408 He scored a touchdown
p258_409 The visual arts committee took this decision in December
p258_410 Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night
p258_411 I believe the gap is nearly there
p258_412 Edinburgh, in fact, was not included in the survey
p258_413 Domestic Disturbance is currently on general release
p258_414 Also, it is the season of goodwill
p259_001 Please call Stella
p259_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p259_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p259_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p259_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p259_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p259_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p259_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p259_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p259_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p259_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p259_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p259_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p259_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p259_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p259_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p259_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p259_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p259_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p259_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p259_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p259_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p259_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p259_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p259_025 But it could prove disastrous
p259_026 Smoking is also very important
p259_027 Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed
p259_028 I am pretty careful with money
p259_029 He has the courage of the unaware
p259_030 I could not do it
p259_031 Everyone can have their opinion
p259_032 The function of the clerk is to provide advice
p259_033 We speak about the performance
p259_034 She is employed on short-term contracts
p259_035 Because he was born in England
p259_036 They have now been banned from Celtic Park for life
p259_037 Child benefit will not be affected
p259_038 It all started with a visiting rugby club
p259_039 I feel so desperately sorry for Gordon and Sarah
p259_040 Clark was desperate to return to the House of Commons
p259_041 It carried a double message
p259_042 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p259_043 Several investments have already been made
p259_044 The boy is no longer with us
p259_045 Among them are many criminals
p259_046 Merger would be entirely logical
p259_047 He looks like an Afghan
p259_048 They had to explain it
p259_049 I had come back from London
p259_050 Pulled a huge number of viewers
p259_051 I had trouble with the producers
p259_052 Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer
p259_053 We have not given up hope
p259_054 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p259_055 The problems are a result of that shortfall
p259_056 They had been in Scotland on exercise
p259_057 Let's hope that it does
p259_058 We have to keep our clients
p259_059 He also has a Scottish grandfather
p259_060 The rate of growth in road traffic is already beginning to slow
p259_061 The Farmer wants a new campaign
p259_062 He hadn't had them for a long time
p259_063 Only water is currently allowed
p259_064 It wasn't possible to relax
p259_065 We should keep this recent assault in perspective
p259_066 Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom
p259_067 She died in hospital two hours later
p259_068 It is a job creation scheme
p259_069 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p259_070 Even the one she loved
p259_071 Today it was really enjoyable
p259_072 Just two months ago it seemed an unlikely threat
p259_073 It was a unanimous decision
p259_074 It makes for an interesting conference
p259_075 I've had it for the exams
p259_076 I first met him last summer
p259_077 I wanted to change the formula
p259_078 It gave no further details
p259_079 Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat
p259_080 Our mother is very worried
p259_081 Potions said he would drive
p259_082 The city council is a major property owner in the area
p259_083 William Hague, the guest of honour, was delighted
p259_084 It is normal for me
p259_085 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?)
p259_086 How are you, sir ?)
p259_087 So is that it, then ?)
p259_088 Do I have a favourite ?)
p259_089 What do we do ?)
p259_090 Why do it otherwise ?)
p259_091 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?)
p259_092 Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll
p259_093 The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation
p259_094 Collaboration is also encouraged by the Medical Research Council and other bodies
p259_095 The allegations were still under investigation, he added
p259_096 We would have concerns about that
p259_097 Ferguson must take the blame
p259_098 Figures are not relevant to the strategy
p259_099 He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels
p259_100 It was clear on Thursday
p259_101 I did not have a bet on myself
p259_102 The selection process is still at a very early stage
p259_103 It's good to have a voice
p259_104 They will remember this victory for a while
p259_105 But they must believe in themselves
p259_106 We haven't finished the complaints procedure
p259_107 The following are the principal provisions
p259_108 It is a good lifestyle
p259_109 We needed financial backing to get it off the ground
p259_110 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p259_111 Our offer represents an attractive price for the business
p259_112 Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National
p259_113 He was jailed for a year
p259_114 The whole thing is the music
p259_115 New Year will be very busy
p259_116 The result is a vacuum
p259_117 This is a milestone in the modernisation of the Scottish prosecution service
p259_118 That was the lesson to be learned from the European Championships
p259_119 We have the mental strength
p259_120 Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month
p259_121 That admission is not surprising
p259_122 In addition, investor choice is reduced
p259_123 We had another last Tuesday
p259_124 It is too pretty, it is too small
p259_125 The abuse of elderly people was appalling
p259_126 We did what we had to do
p259_127 But it is different in different regions
p259_128 They made such decisions in London
p259_129 Tiger is not the norm
p259_130 It is a variable condition and the diagnosis is difficult
p259_131 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p259_132 I am totally devoted to this job
p259_133 Before it was an ordeal
p259_134 It could be done by experts and lawyers
p259_135 Reaction to the device was mixed
p259_136 Suddenly, the Fir Park side were in disarray
p259_137 It was started almost by accident
p259_138 Scotland will finish the group in second place
p259_139 I think he's the favourite, no question
p259_140 I'm so grateful for that
p259_141 But she was very human
p259_142 What happened in that game ?)
p259_143 Are you going to win ?)
p259_144 Was it the wife ?)
p259_145 Why change it ?)
p259_146 What do we want to do that for ?)
p259_147 Does the name matter ?)
p259_148 how do you get it back ?)
p259_149 Commercial producers were present in large numbers
p259_150 The referee faces a massive job
p259_151 His second goal was equally impressive
p259_152 He was seen as the enemy
p259_153 That group reported just before Christmas
p259_154 Five minutes later, the home team were back in front
p259_155 It opens the door to the Champions League
p259_156 So I got a blood test
p259_157 No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday
p259_158 I haven't made any definite decisions
p259_159 The two companies were not for sale
p259_160 People were actually not on his side
p259_161 We have to speed up the process
p259_162 There's only one team in Ayrshire
p259_163 The weather forecast isn't good
p259_164 Nothing was meant by it
p259_165 Behind him was his brother
p259_166 It was by the numbers
p259_167 The woman was his wife
p259_168 This action reflects a slump in bookings
p259_169 He was right into football from an early age
p259_170 The Internet is no substitute for customer service
p259_171 It's never great to finish second
p259_172 You have to ask whether they have really thought through these issues
p259_173 We have a budget in March
p259_174 Adventure is the champagne of life
p259_175 US is the only country to vote against resolution
p259_176 The reviews were welcomed by business lobby groups
p259_177 The people are the hero
p259_178 I always felt they played for me
p259_179 You have got to get people from all sorts of different directions
p259_180 The second aspect was the fear of failure
p259_181 Phase one was a shambles
p259_182 If that's the case, he will struggle
p259_183 It is vital to clarify their role
p259_184 I'm just going to hit the shot
p259_185 Mr Docherty said the whole family was shocked
p259_186 Each case is treated on merit
p259_187 It is only the beginning
p259_188 He played it like a veteran
p259_189 Our destiny is in our own hands
p259_190 That's not fair to the supporters
p259_191 We've just had it confirmed
p259_192 I will have to order its destruction
p259_193 You know the sort of thing
p259_194 I cannot say too much about them
p259_195 But there's an upturn in the sector
p259_196 It shows the strength of the roots
p259_197 I'm interested in interesting work
p259_198 Shelter also supports the reform
p259_199 We represent a wide range of society
p259_200 Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender
p259_201 It caused a lot of upset
p259_202 It had little effect on European equity markets
p259_203 This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds
p259_204 It's very difficult to find a buyer
p259_205 Neither side would reveal the details of the offer
p259_206 In due course we will make an announcement
p259_207 He should emerge as the winner
p259_208 He was then replaced by Ross
p259_209 And they were being paid ?)
p259_210 was everything done to save people ?)
p259_211 What was the matter for concern ?)
p259_212 Do I think about them often ?)
p259_213 Is it in the right place ?)
p259_214 Did he trip ?)
p259_215 For the meantime, though, the signs are good
p259_216 Here the picture is broadly stable
p259_217 This will be our new beginning
p259_218 Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon
p259_219 The early physical reports were clear
p259_220 The result is utterly compelling
p259_221 Stephen has never considered the question of compensation
p259_222 This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill
p259_223 We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead
p259_224 Little is known about them
p259_225 I won't make an official complaint
p259_226 It was worth a photograph
p259_227 The move follows a review of the Singapore)
p259_228 We have an election in eight days
p259_229 Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match
p259_230 January is a bad time of year
p259_231 HARRY Potter has lost his magic
p259_232 Today we must not repeat that mistake
p259_233 From there, they can go anywhere
p259_234 I am delighted for Simon
p259_235 It had all been arranged
p259_236 My daughter is an adult
p259_237 His third goal was superb
p259_238 It was finally agreed on Saturday
p259_239 They are difficult awards to decide
p259_240 I am considered a teenager
p259_241 Anyway, the job will be part-time
p259_242 He must get to know himself
p259_243 The transaction is not feasible
p259_244 People should make their own decisions
p259_245 The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo
p259_246 Things were so intense in the studio
p259_247 We will reform the welfare state
p259_248 His background is firmly in venture capital
p259_249 It's easy to be negative about these things
p259_250 I didn't play too well in the third quarter
p259_251 The scientific debate is dead
p259_252 Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh
p259_253 You are like an animal
p259_254 The body follows the mind
p259_255 We will try to find someone
p259_256 It had so much to do with output
p259_257 The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high
p259_258 I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight
p259_259 Half of young people had had contact with the police
p259_260 It will now be revived
p259_261 Italy is a beautiful place
p259_262 I have never heard a rule that you could be too young
p259_263 I was just a kid
p259_264 Does that put pressure on us ?)
p259_265 Did it work ?)
p259_266 Do you think we are a top nation ?)
p259_267 Is our children learning ?)
p259_268 How independent is that ?)
p259_269 What form did that take ?)
p259_270 He was good, but not that good
p259_271 He said the right things
p259_272 Mr Crawford is no stranger to Scottish Enterprise
p259_273 I have received no explanation
p259_274 He also launched a new strategy for the agency
p259_275 Kingfisher can afford to wait
p259_276 Defensive stocks attracted some interest
p259_277 You can feel at home in China
p259_278 I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record
p259_279 Either way, the investor retains the premium
p259_280 No date has been fixed for his return
p259_281 We will listen to any suggestion
p259_282 Washington is consumed by the crisis
p259_283 I should think so, too
p259_284 It makes no difference to their friendship
p259_285 Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland
p259_286 You have got the evidence
p259_287 We accept the new rules
p259_288 It is probably in the culture
p259_289 On the contrary they stand to gain
p259_290 Blair is very positive at European Councils
p259_291 He took over our lives
p259_292 I rejected the idea of a separate residence
p259_293 I'd never run for them
p259_294 It is a mark of respect from the inmates
p259_295 They must play for each other
p259_296 These figures are truly terrible
p259_297 I felt about this big
p259_298 It is also very valuable
p259_299 There's not much money in cycling
p259_300 The stage was set for a showdown
p259_301 This could put pressure on UK inflation
p259_302 He raised the profile of the European Tour to the sky
p259_303 We're trying to get rounded performers
p259_304 They can leave at any time
p259_305 We shall rely on human beings
p259_306 It has the potential to be another North Sea
p259_307 We have a high quality product
p259_308 Blair also had a penalty
p259_309 Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate
p259_310 I understand the security issue
p259_311 Frankly, we should all have such problems
p259_312 It seemed a logical expansion
p259_313 We have an excellent record of passenger growth and customer service
p259_314 It was at the Royal Concert Hall in Glasgow
p259_315 It's hard to see it
p259_316 The record companies have gone through the floor
p259_317 This would provide a significant and welcome boost for local employment
p259_318 It was not hard to feel some sympathy for Baxter yesterday
p259_319 Gerhard Schroeder was the victor
p259_320 Authorities have to recognise the risk of paedophiles
p259_321 The circumstances have changed since last year
p259_322 We will deliver at director level
p259_323 We feel very comfortable in this international environment
p259_324 I couldn't really work outside Edinburgh
p259_325 We would hope to make progress on that next year
p259_326 Again the parallel with football can be drawn
p259_327 I will never change our policy on paying appearance money
p259_328 And that culture is everywhere In Dublin
p259_329 I was just so determined
p259_330 No Briton has ever won
p259_331 Are they free ?)
p259_332 What are they for ?)
p259_333 Is there a waiting list ?)
p259_334 Do they think anyone else wants them ?)
p259_335 So what happens next ?)
p259_336 Had this been common practice ?)
p259_337 What do they want us to do ?)
p259_338 Is it worth it ?)
p259_339 His appeal is instantly understood
p259_340 The results are sometimes contentious
p259_341 The songs are just so good
p259_342 This will save interest charges
p259_343 Shareholders will be asked to approve a new replacement scheme
p259_344 Sunday's game was not a trial
p259_345 Our message to the Monetary Policy Committee is clear
p259_346 McNaughton was not so sure
p259_347 Job losses were also announced
p259_348 A police inquiry began about two weeks before the General Election
p259_349 The party lasted all night
p259_350 The pound has also suffered
p259_351 Scotland has shown the way
p259_352 There will be good prospects ahead
p259_353 We think the timing is good
p259_354 He will go a long way
p259_355 We want to play at the worlds
p259_356 Other people had looked at it
p259_357 The advisers had some discussions but no conclusion was reached
p259_358 I didn't have the reply
p259_359 The output price index in December was unchanged on November
p259_360 You may have a short memory
p259_361 Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure
p259_362 A Home Office spokesman said
p259_363 Urgent action is needed to tackle this crisis
p259_364 It's too horrible to think
p259_365 Hopefully, he will get a lucky break
p259_366 Industrial action has to hurt
p259_367 Nobody said it was required
p259_368 It was tough to contain the excitement
p259_369 They promised to fight the plans
p259_370 Shoppers were attracted by the heavy discounting on selected items
p259_371 He was unable to come
p259_372 He was at school in Devon
p259_373 Many of these properties are located in the south of England
p259_374 Finally came the moment of truth
p259_375 Whether this return was too soon
p259_376 Neither man has been charged
p259_377 An alternative must be offered
p259_378 It is understood the timescale for the refurbishment has slipped
p259_379 It has to solve the nuclear waste disposal problem
p259_380 He can handle it without any problem
p259_381 But the disease has not been confined to the Tory Party
p259_382 He is an excellent manager
p259_383 I think we'll just keep it
p259_384 The Allies intend to maintain the average
p259_385 I've always been a sensitive
p259_386 After five weeks the vehicle will be sold at auction
p259_387 He had no previous convictions
p259_388 It was a massive error of judgment
p259_389 They should take their mobile phones
p259_390 Despite his senior position, he did not know in advance
p259_391 They have broken that promise
p259_392 Does it matter ?)
p259_393 How do you take them away ?)
p259_394 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?)
p259_395 After the match, do you ?)
p259_396 That is a crazy situation
p259_397 We are really good friends
p259_398 The principle is quite clear
p259_399 The salary changes are long overdue
p259_400 The policy has led to a big increase in customer recruitment
p259_401 She said they would appeal
p259_402 They were to blame for the first two goals
p259_403 It would be quite nice
p259_404 This remains the party's policy
p259_405 In addition, it was in breach of natural justice
p259_406 The parties include the Scottish Executive
p259_407 We will win the argument
p259_408 Everything is now in place for Manchester
p259_409 Tomorrow will be a different game entirely
p259_410 The team hadn't been picked
p259_411 The prosecution say the girl was the only witness to the attack
p259_412 It sounds like a wish list
p259_413 The director will be present
p259_414 It is the nature of his party
p259_415 Theatre is not a museum
p259_416 We have very limited capacity
p259_417 It is a serious offence of reckless conduct
p259_418 My view has now completely changed
p259_419 I had a fortunate war
p259_420 It's too close to call
p259_421 I was happy to be recognised by Mike Tyson
p259_422 I'm not going to get upset by two comedy promoters
p259_423 I've had a wonderful career
p259_424 The BBC was a disgrace
p259_425 It is hard to understand
p259_426 But the foundations have been laid
p259_427 There was an element of frustration
p259_428 In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations
p259_429 The casualties were not named
p259_430 The next few months will tell
p259_431 It is not over by any means
p259_432 A ceasefire is a ceasefire is a ceasefire
p259_433 Three years ago he would have been
p259_434 They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune
p259_435 I watch the other visitors
p259_436 George is on a two-day visit to Scotland
p259_437 Even if they come out playing a physical game, we can cope
p259_438 This market has been neglected by the whisky industry
p259_439 There is a solution, she believes
p259_440 His ambition was made this year when he played alongside his son
p259_441 It was submitted without their knowledge
p259_442 The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia
p259_443 My aim is a top six finish
p259_444 It means an enormous amount
p259_445 Such an attack is bizarre
p259_446 If he saw somebody in trouble, he would try to help
p259_447 I never had a childhood
p259_448 No-one wanted to run it tonight
p259_449 None of the pieces was commissioned
p259_450 There is another important factor
p259_451 I never found my rhythm
p259_452 In fact, the reasons are simple
p259_453 Strangely enough I felt very sharp
p259_454 It is not an inquiry to clear the athletes
p259_455 Nobody has told the story
p259_456 Last week against Nelson, we allowed them several opportunities
p259_457 He confirmed the coaching structure was already under review
p259_458 Senior management in Scotland threw its weight behind the orchestra
p259_459 The project is entitled The Composer in Scotland
p259_460 It is pretty bad news
p259_461 It certainly appeared that way
p259_462 We put our bid in last night
p259_463 Quality was high in all sections
p259_464 It could cause a little bit of disruption
p259_465 But we have built a platform for next season
p259_466 I think the goalkeeper should have gone
p259_467 They offer a kind of narrative
p259_468 She came to the Highland Show
p259_469 It was like someone had died
p259_470 They were good years for him
p259_471 Let that be their memorial
p259_472 Then came the farewell to Europe
p259_473 I'm very passionate about my country
p259_474 Phil Mickelson did that last year
p259_475 There was no trouble at all
p259_476 He deserved a red card
p259_477 The price paid for it was not disclosed
p259_478 You have to have a proven track record to get them
p259_479 Some problems were too complex
p259_480 Their one weakness was running between the wickets
p259_481 The chief constable has retired
p267_001 Please call Stella
p267_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p267_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p267_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p267_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p267_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p267_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p267_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p267_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p267_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p267_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p267_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p267_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p267_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p267_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p267_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p267_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p267_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p267_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p267_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p267_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p267_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of a super-imposition of a number of bows
p267_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p267_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p267_025 A shortlist is to be drawn up next month
p267_026 He may not need to force that message
p267_027 There is no reason at all
p267_028 Suggestions of the action being a punishment were dismissed
p267_029 Because we do not need it
p267_030 We will look into it
p267_031 This is a central issue
p267_032 Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy
p267_033 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p267_034 I became a widow overnight
p267_035 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p267_036 A week is a long time in politics
p267_037 Iain Duncan Smith is a decent man
p267_038 This represents a tough game for us
p267_039 She hopes to study in Britain one day
p267_040 It is difficult for Ali
p267_041 The whole of southern Africa is in the grip of Aids
p267_042 He is too weak to move
p267_043 Everything else is a bonus
p267_044 This is the interesting part
p267_045 I guess I was lucky, though
p267_046 Pulled a huge number of viewers
p267_047 Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer
p267_048 There was no safety net
p267_049 They just thought it was extremely good acting
p267_050 It is a different animal
p267_051 The City welcomed the brighter outlook
p267_052 I must take a seat
p267_053 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p267_054 Four other charges were dropped
p267_055 So I liked the challenge
p267_056 He becomes the new Minister for Sport and Culture
p267_057 That way I won't have to do anything
p267_058 It's just the timing of the game
p267_059 Strathclyde police have appealed for witnesses
p267_060 We need to increase the membership
p267_061 He was at home with his pals
p267_062 They are in the euro
p267_063 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p267_064 How are you, sir ?
p267_065 So is that it, then ?
p267_066 Do I have a favourite ?
p267_067 There could be a way back
p267_068 They would now be able to look forward with confidence
p267_069 Her body was found on Monday morning
p267_070 They do not work for Glasgow City Council
p267_071 Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom
p267_072 A government is a government is a government
p267_073 Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator
p267_074 That is bound to happen
p267_075 He is in the queue
p267_076 He seems to be pleased with the picture
p267_077 Otherwise, it will cost a lot of money
p267_078 He can win every week
p267_079 By then, he was walking on water
p267_080 It's so hard to shift
p267_081 They lived for their children
p267_082 The cut is excellent news for the consumer
p267_083 There was no way back for United after that
p267_084 This time, it will have opened up the field a little bit
p267_085 That deal will be decided under the existing rules
p267_086 They need to find a form of words
p267_087 A year ago, she was just a junior Minister at the Treasury
p267_088 It's for that reason he should resign
p267_089 The rescue package is public money
p267_090 Before the game we went for a pint
p267_091 Our house was very small
p267_092 They were a lovely couple
p267_093 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p267_094 It's not a lack of effort
p267_095 That means an extra two years
p267_096 Then came the collision with Sergio
p267_097 It is a total and utter change of culture
p267_098 Sport is good for you
p267_099 We need to handle it
p267_100 They will notice a difference
p267_102 Such actions are rarely popular
p267_103 He has done that with a great deal to spare
p267_104 Then again, we could have
p267_105 She's got to say something
p267_106 I was always a little behind
p267_107 There were no grounds for his action
p267_108 That admission is not surprising
p267_109 We have a training class
p267_110 Well, you can have a tree
p267_111 Becoming a father was wonderful
p267_112 I was on a roll
p267_113 What do we do ?
p267_114 Why do it otherwise ?
p267_115 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p267_116 The abuse of elderly people was appalling
p267_117 Something will be done by corporate bodies
p267_118 We did what we had to do
p267_119 I am the Son of Sam
p267_120 You've got to be vigilant
p267_121 Tiger is not the norm
p267_122 My conscience is not clear
p267_123 Nobody in the world can get away from him
p267_124 It would make a lot of sense
p267_125 They could use a boost
p267_126 He felt that everything that was said about asylum seekers was negative
p267_127 Alice, the girl, was said by doctors to be in good condition
p267_128 They scored with a penalty and a breakaway
p267_129 He was seen as the enemy
p267_130 That group reported just before Christmas
p267_131 Five minutes later, the home team were back in front
p267_132 Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes
p267_133 It was a piece of art
p267_134 I am just trying to do my job
p267_135 So I got a blood test
p267_136 It has become a way of life
p267_137 I was caught out a little bit
p267_138 The petition was formally presented at Downing Street yesterday
p267_139 It has to be an event
p267_140 It was deployed in the Gulf War
p267_141 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p267_142 She had gone to the Catholic school
p267_143 It is ambitious, but it can be achieved
p267_144 It was by the numbers
p267_145 We will turn the corner
p267_146 This year, this month, will be special for Torrance
p267_147 Inside, the atmosphere was quiet
p267_148 There was a definite prejudice
p267_149 Alex has been a huge influence on the club
p267_150 Not a great deal has changed in the last decade
p267_151 Adams is surely worth a chance
p267_152 That is not too bad
p267_153 We are still getting over it
p267_154 As, indeed, they would be
p267_155 We came across the first set of bodies
p267_156 Seven people were later detained by police
p267_157 I would probably have to agree with him
p267_158 We were given a warm and friendly reception
p267_159 However, he urged the trade to keep the faith
p267_160 Nobody did in those days
p267_161 So what is the campaign about ?
p267_162 And does it ?
p267_163 Are you from the rugby ?
p267_164 Had I heard ?
p267_165 Well, this article is a bit like that
p267_166 It's nice to be nice
p267_167 The people are the hero
p267_168 I always felt they played for me
p267_169 It is premature to speculate on the impact
p267_170 They made such decisions in London
p267_171 It is a body blow
p267_172 First and foremost, the game is entirely different
p267_173 It was a miserable afternoon in Fife
p267_174 It is not a threat
p267_175 I would not count on it
p267_176 He played it like a veteran
p267_177 I have spoken to head office
p267_178 The referee had a good game
p267_179 The European Union is a case in point
p267_180 They need to look after themselves
p267_181 It is a common problem
p267_182 A team is a team
p267_183 Aberdeen had little to offer
p267_184 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p267_185 It was a pre-emptive strike
p267_186 A terrorist is a terrorist
p267_187 People will ask about us
p267_188 I had come back from London
p267_189 This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds
p267_190 It's very difficult to find a buyer
p267_191 Final proposals will be published in February
p267_192 Tony Blair's official spokesman said
p267_193 If I was a woman
p267_194 I came home by ambulance
p267_195 I suggest a new plan
p267_196 The conference is the first test
p267_197 Tommy is not a problem
p267_198 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p267_199 He had suffered a heart attack
p267_200 I won't make an official complaint
p267_201 A bit of match fitness is required
p267_202 It is an impressive record
p267_203 There is no quick fix
p267_204 Abbey National is an option
p267_205 It has been like that all year for me
p267_206 HARRY Potter has lost his magic
p267_207 Today we must not repeat that mistake
p267_208 From there, they can go anywhere
p267_209 I had relied on him
p267_210 The course has helped a lot
p267_211 I'm just a regular person
p267_212 My life is in the ballet
p267_213 He would discuss the peace process in Northern Ireland
p267_214 They're going to open in early summer
p267_215 Anyway, the job will be part-time
p267_216 I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery
p267_217 It is good for our team
p267_218 It was a crazy day
p267_219 Edinburgh was not included in the survey
p267_220 Because they didn't want to know
p267_221 Women were mostly notable by their absence
p267_222 You have to do your research
p267_223 What do we want to do that for ?
p267_224 Does the name matter ?
p267_225 how do you get it back ?
p267_226 What are you not good at ?
p267_227 William Hague delighted his party
p267_228 You could feel the heat
p267_229 Murray Financial has fallen at the first hurdle
p267_230 The boy is no longer with us
p267_231 I didn't play too well in the third quarter
p267_232 A small number of new jobs will also be created
p267_233 My wife and family are the support system
p267_234 And he goes with it
p267_235 They tried to give her advice
p267_236 Pensions are a long-term investment
p267_237 She died in middle age
p267_238 I'm so proud to be Scottish tonight
p267_239 Those overseas offices were great
p267_240 You will have seen the adverts
p267_242 It is the loss of my name
p267_243 The irony was not lost
p267_244 We have come a long way in the last few sessions
p267_245 I am still waiting for a reply
p267_246 It is a court case
p267_247 He has been a success this year
p267_248 It might be sad, but it's a fact
p267_249 He declined to give any details
p267_250 It seems a waste of talents
p267_251 Clearly, the need for a personal loan is written in the stars
p267_252 If so, it is a funny time to introduce it
p267_253 His is a global perspective
p267_254 It is a policy which has the full support of the minister
p267_255 In the meantime, the fans would settle for a derby win
p267_256 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p267_257 It was a cry for help
p267_258 They were back in full training yesterday
p267_259 No production contract is yet in sight
p267_260 Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland
p267_261 There will be widespread support on all sides
p267_262 The capital costs are modest
p267_263 It was the climax of the thing
p267_264 I can't get a job
p267_265 I've had no discussions with the chairman or the board
p267_266 On the contrary they stand to gain
p267_267 This news came after the stock market closed on Monday
p267_268 It is a mark of respect from the inmates
p267_269 It does not work that way in Scottish football
p267_270 It is also very valuable
p267_271 It disappeared into the cup
p267_272 The stage was set for a showdown
p267_273 Not many companies can say that these days
p267_274 He will emerge as a world leader
p267_275 We're trying to get rounded performers
p267_276 A lot of their players have developed in the English league
p267_277 It has the potential to be another North Sea
p267_278 It is set in Paris
p267_279 He has run a hell of a race
p267_280 It would create a Scottish secretary with a lot of weight
p267_281 He was also married with two children
p267_282 It will include the Black Watch, the Royal Highland regiment
p267_283 It's great, because it takes a lot of pressure off the players
p267_284 They failed to reach agreement yesterday
p267_285 That goes back a long way
p267_286 And they were being paid ?
p267_287 was everything done to save people ?
p267_288 What was the matter for concern ?
p267_289 Do I think about them often ?
p267_290 Stephen will get his first cap
p267_291 They were on holiday in Egypt
p267_292 The partnership was set up during the summer
p267_293 We have a plan in place
p267_294 I felt like I was a child
p267_295 Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished
p267_296 He wants to talk a lot
p267_297 The attacker died in the crash
p267_298 It is inherent in society
p267_299 He refused to name the survivors
p267_300 It's difficult to predict the future
p267_301 That is the general feeling
p267_302 I am a retailer by nature
p267_303 Well, he can do it
p267_304 The weather forecast isn't good
p267_305 The judge was really nice
p267_306 Disruption will be kept to a minimum
p267_307 It is a potential danger
p267_308 The tournament has now been cancelled
p267_309 Cast Away now on general release
p267_310 It is a road of death
p267_311 We will make a statement tomorrow
p267_312 There were no passengers on board
p267_313 You will never get a conviction
p267_314 I will not be afraid
p267_316 He has left the company
p267_317 I am not concerned with protection of the public
p267_318 People can really get themselves in a mess
p267_319 I would do away with the dress code
p267_320 He declined to reveal the offer price which was accepted
p267_321 He has been told by the doctor to rest
p267_322 We want to play at the worlds
p267_323 After some discussion they did
p267_325 It is all credit to them today
p267_326 The deal was presented yesterday as a merger
p267_327 You are looking at him
p267_328 This is a source of real concern for the area
p267_329 It's not an easy life
p267_330 The election is total confusion and chaos
p267_331 It will decide today whether he should be struck off the register
p267_332 The problems began a long time ago
p267_333 It makes a compelling display
p267_334 That is a trend which will be encouraged
p267_335 But the New Year was special
p267_336 They are now out in the cold
p267_337 There was no time scale
p267_338 Does that put pressure on us ?
p267_339 Did it work ?
p267_340 Do you think we are a top nation ?
p267_341 It was tough to contain the excitement
p267_342 It is a strong case
p267_343 A report is expected next month
p267_344 The US Open was very difficult, but it was enjoyable
p267_345 They were the acts of men
p267_346 It wasn't a flight of fancy
p267_347 He was then replaced by Ross
p267_348 Many of these properties are located in the south of England
p267_349 He is not very big, either
p267_350 I have a moral dilemma
p267_351 This might seem like an outrageous assertion
p267_352 Finally, he paid for the movie
p267_353 Last night, he pledged to clear his name
p267_354 Some will be deployed on submarines
p267_355 He did a good job
p267_356 It intends to do so on Wednesday
p267_357 It is a stroke of genius
p267_358 In the early days, I was obsessed with working in the theatre
p267_359 We live on an island
p267_360 George Mitchell is trying to close the gap
p267_361 They have created a business
p267_362 I got a yellow card
p267_363 I am considered a teenager
p267_364 There may be reasons for it
p267_365 This is a major championship
p267_366 It's only a matter of scale
p267_367 She is now on the back benches
p267_368 They were to blame for the first two goals
p267_369 There is no deal as yet
p267_370 You must have a government and a good civil service
p267_371 to have products for their needs
p267_372 The pair are very much in love
p267_373 They are used to the big stage
p267_374 The marshall at the turn was great
p267_375 On fuel, the Chancellor has a number of options
p267_376 The seller was not revealed
p267_377 People are on the alert
p267_378 Here, too, the Post Office has missed the boat
p267_379 In fact, he was great today
p267_380 We operate as a Scottish company
p267_381 He has been in a nursing home for two years
p267_382 A review is under way
p267_383 They have not done so this season so far
p267_384 This big issue is whether it can be enforced
p267_385 Safety was also an issue
p267_386 We have made no final decisions
p267_387 They like being on the front pages of the newspapers
p267_388 The results will take second place
p267_389 It was a funny game
p267_390 I tried to be cautious, but it's hard in that role
p267_391 It does not even have a staff shortage
p267_392 The Cabinet is split over the issue
p267_393 Ms McNeill was killed on impact
p267_394 Overall, the labour market continued to tighten
p267_395 We shall not be moved
p267_396 I watch the other visitors
p267_397 I remain a buyer of the shares
p267_398 There were no plans for a rights issue
p267_399 That's all I can say
p267_400 Are they free ?
p267_401 What are they for ?
p267_402 Is there a waiting list ?
p267_403 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p267_404 You thought it was a headache
p267_405 Family liaison officers are now working to support the family
p267_406 I thought he was an animal
p267_407 None of the agencies was able to help
p267_408 We will stand for the nation
p267_409 I'm pleased about one thing
p267_410 In time, may prove a worthy successor to Billy Dodds
p267_411 The charity also has a project in Moscow in Russia
p267_412 My aim is a top six finish
p267_413 Such an attack is bizarre
p267_414 These guys are looking for business
p267_415 He is on the wrong side
p267_416 By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started
p267_417 This is no reflection on Rangers
p267_418 Further new equity was raised in a placing in January
p267_419 It needs to be volatile
p267_420 I've got my own ideas
p267_421 Nobody should believe this story
p268_001 Please call Stella
p268_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p268_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p268_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p268_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p268_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p268_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p268_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p268_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p268_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p268_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p268_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p268_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p268_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p268_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p268_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p268_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p268_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p268_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p268_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p268_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p268_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p268_025 They might have asked, for goodness sake
p268_026 He got very close tonight
p268_027 Smoking is also very important
p268_028 Wages and salaries account for a major proportion of our expenses
p268_029 The first appeared to be successful
p268_030 We must convince the citizens
p268_031 Carlton also declined to comment last night
p268_032 She is employed on short-term contracts
p268_033 Further management changes are planned
p268_034 Nonetheless, the overall picture is healthy
p268_035 It's as we were yesterday
p268_036 We are opening an inquiry
p268_037 He works at the airport
p268_038 Why do you want to come to Edinburgh ?
p268_039 How are you, sir ?
p268_040 So is that it, then ?
p268_041 Do I have a favourite ?
p268_042 What do we do ?
p268_043 Why do it otherwise ?
p268_044 However, the purchase is as yet unproven
p268_045 Overall it has been deeply frustrating and disappointing
p268_046 Something has to give sometime
p268_047 Her husband had been waiting for her return
p268_048 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p268_049 The latter option was chosen
p268_050 The head teacher was a highly effective leader and manager
p268_051 The man became a reporter
p268_052 Marconi is struggling against terrible market forces
p268_053 The thought of playing in the English Premiership has tremendous appeal
p268_054 Among them are many criminals
p268_055 I knew my contract was up this year
p268_056 The whole thing was filmed in Hollywood
p268_057 But it couldn't happen overnight
p268_058 It was just too much for us
p268_059 Perhaps we should do the same
p268_060 They desperately want some stability
p268_061 Everything is possible in football
p268_062 He looks like an Afghan
p268_063 This trend is likely to strengthen
p268_064 Europe will bear the brunt of the cuts
p268_065 He will need that machine
p268_066 Debate was impassioned and furious
p268_067 I would not say that
p268_068 This was a far cry from his election pledges
p268_069 Pulled a huge number of viewers
p268_070 The regional newspapers have outperformed the national titles
p268_071 A spokeswoman for the Law Society of Scotland said
p268_072 We deserved the three points
p268_073 The wingers must have felt the cold
p268_074 I am relishing the challenge
p268_075 Let's hope that it does
p268_076 But the organisers refused to worry
p268_077 We have to keep our clients
p268_078 We should be able to cope
p268_079 He also had a Scottish grandfather
p268_080 Autumn is the time of fulfilment
p268_081 George Robertson described the plan as an outrageous and disgraceful decision
p268_082 But I had never been in a theatre
p268_083 He admitted afterwards that he didn't know much about it
p268_084 Kenny Miller might come through
p268_085 Scottish football is finally on its way back
p268_086 He's not getting into any games
p268_087 We will pay their bills
p268_088 It is time for new ways for the church
p268_089 It was exactly four months away
p268_090 I am glad I wasn't in it
p268_091 THE Farmer wants a new campaign
p268_092 In fact, I have even had a bet on them
p268_093 Final proposals will be published in February
p268_094 What kind of man does that, Mr Dick ?
p268_095 So, did she meet him ?
p268_096 So what is the campaign about ?
p268_097 And does it ?
p268_098 Are you from the rugby ?
p268_099 Had I heard ?
p268_100 What happened in that game ?
p268_101 Are you going to win ?
p268_102 You should try to have a laugh
p268_103 There can be no compromise on welfare
p268_104 He will be kept informed
p268_105 Maybe this battle has been
p268_106 We should keep this recent assault in perspective
p268_107 They do not work for Glasgow City Council
p268_108 Wilson made his remarks on Tuesday
p268_109 Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator
p268_110 Instead, another depression came in
p268_111 Even the one she loved
p268_112 We have thought about doing lots of things
p268_113 England were ahead until two minutes into injury time
p268_114 Well, he is an artist
p268_115 Everything else is a bonus
p268_116 Harrowing is easy, after all
p268_117 Those people must be accountable
p268_118 If they liked it then I'll be happy
p268_119 They would be supported by visiting specialists
p268_120 The ethos of the school was outstanding
p268_121 Or so the story goes
p268_122 Accordingly, financial restructuring is required
p268_123 Others may have, but I'm a fighter
p268_124 We shall rely on human beings
p268_125 McPherson came from United Biscuits
p268_126 On Saturday, it was much the same
p268_127 The Breadwinner came home from Africa
p268_128 Their season has been consigned to history
p268_129 It wasn't possible to relax
p268_130 Manager Neil Cooper revealed yesterday
p268_131 But then they scored their fourth
p268_132 Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll
p268_133 Monty is great in his own backyard
p268_134 Brown also believes in Walker's innocence
p268_135 That deal will be decided under the existing rules
p268_137 All the employees are redundant
p268_138 Absences should be carefully monitored
p268_139 He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels
p268_140 The rise in retail sales was the first since August
p268_141 Colin said, You get through the day-to-day by looking at the future
p268_142 The tribunal said his conduct was wholly reprehensible
p268_143 It wasn't about her singing, though
p268_144 He was forced to quit
p268_145 What do we want to do that for ?
p268_146 Does the name matter ?
p268_147 how do you get it back ?
p268_148 I was left-handed, but it was just a matter of practice
p268_149 Dumfries and Galloway Council said it was not breaking the Government's directions
p268_150 I was given no instructions by no-one
p268_151 The move follows a review of the Singapore
p268_152 We're not taking any risks
p268_153 It's very dangerous for markets
p268_154 That's what happened against Ayr
p268_155 Prospects for equity markets remain uncertain
p268_156 The following are the principal provisions
p268_157 But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant
p268_158 Before the game we went for a pint
p268_160 We feel very comfortable in this international environment
p268_161 Athletics is on a roll in the country
p268_162 The milk industry is in turmoil
p268_163 He plans to call for an aid package from Mr Macdonald
p268_164 And so the cycle continues
p268_165 But the relief was short-lived
p268_166 They exist in name alone
p268_167 YOU cannot blame the turnout
p268_168 We have reacted well to each other
p268_169 There were no plans for a rights issue
p268_170 I can see it now
p268_171 What was the matter for concern ?
p268_172 Do I think about them often ?
p268_173 Is it in the right place ?
p268_174 I will never change our policy on paying appearance money
p268_175 There's still plenty time left
p268_176 Among them was Gary Robertson from Dundee
p268_177 The upturn in the housing market has given a big boost
p268_178 We are happy with the referee
p268_179 Emergency services were also on stand-by outside

p268_181 Pressure of work is no excuse
p268_182 Strathclyde Police are expected to make an announcement next month
p268_183 The hearing was due to continue today
p268_184 His job was not advertised
p268_185 The culture is extremely widespread and vibrant
p268_186 That was just one night
p268_187 My father died in childbirth
p268_188 They keep the atmosphere in mind
p268_189 Millions of British jobs depend on Europe
p268_190 Sloppy answers are to be avoided
p268_191 That is an entirely unacceptable position
p268_192 This is a frightening development
p268_193 In addition, margins have been maintained
p268_194 Lee Westwood has other ideas
p268_195 The Yugoslav army will still be there

p268_200 But he admitted he could not speak for the new owner
p268_201 You are a gambling man
p268_202 It is all to do with the coaching
p268_203 There was a fine line to tread
p268_204 The refund is fully justified
p268_205 McCarthy said it would look at other means of tackling market abuse
p268_206 We believe a third party was involved
p268_207 I love the spectacle of cinema
p268_208 It would make a lot of sense
p268_209 I think he's the favourite, no question
p268_210 The partnership was set up during the summer
p268_211 Bottling is now the core business
p268_212 People have been wonderful beyond belief
p268_213 I enjoy the creative process
p268_214 Don Hutchison, too, is a threat
p268_215 The whole thing was just unreal
p268_216 The music is therefore profoundly subversive
p268_217 However, this concern appears to be misguided
p268_218 That group reported just before Christmas
p268_219 We had to add value
p268_220 Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes
p268_221 My players have no idea about football
p268_222 Arnie ignores the suggestion that he has ever been anywhere else
p268_223 It opens the door to the Champions League
p268_224 IT S all change at Kilmarnock
p268_225 So I got a blood test
p268_226 Stagecoach is seeking a new finance director
p268_227 He wants to be competing for titles and medals
p268_228 There's always the next century
p268_229 For businesses, the benefits will be enormous
p268_230 That proved enough to settle the home side down
p268_231 Finding suitable replacements would not be easy
p268_232 Years ago it was really quite simple
p268_233 Crucially, though, United were still alive
p268_234 Kingfisher reports interim figures tomorrow
p268_235 They've got some extremely good players
p268_236 The point is raised again that evening at the Assembly Rooms
p268_237 And they removed a Borderer
p268_238 Does that put pressure on us ?
p268_239 Did it work ?
p268_240 Do you think we are a top nation ?
p268_241 It would seem a natural progression
p268_242 Meanwhile, the search continues for Ferguson's replacement
p268_243 We will turn the corner
p268_244 Of course, it is a tough assignment
p268_245 There was no basis for their arrest
p268_246 This wasn't just a big crowd
p268_247 The best thing for me was to join the Army
p268_248 This is absolutely not true
p268_249 This action reflects a slump in bookings
p268_250 They should stop the bombing
p268_251 These days are long gone
p268_252 I've come here for the jersey
p268_253 The question is whether private investors should follow their example
p268_254 The strong performance is expected to continue
p268_255 Their extinction is not inevitable
p268_256 It's never great to finish second
p268_257 Bin Laden was not mentioned
p268_258 Allen is strong in every shape and form
p268_259 Her political persuasion is no secret
p268_260 We have a budget in March
p268_261 The Dutchman was pleased with the result
p268_262 You had to go and see him
p268_263 The shoppers knew it before City investors did
p268_264 The planning appears to have paid off
p268_265 Further growth will be funded from cash flow
p268_266 We believe in the medium term
p268_267 Bobby Williamson has been brilliant
p268_268 They were never seen again by friends or relatives
p268_269 They could not match it
p268_270 In the event, it proved a largely uplifting experience
p268_271 A more exhaustive analysis is in progress
p268_272 I came up through the ranks
p268_273 A warning may be sufficient to reform behaviour
p268_274 Luckily, our patient was stable
p268_275 They made such decisions in London
p268_276 Clearly, they had other problems
p268_277 First, the programme was unbalanced
p268_278 The happiness was slightly misplaced
p268_279 Phase one was a shambles
p268_280 If that's the case, he will struggle
p268_282 A winter of discontent awaits
p268_283 But no party would win overall control of Scotland
p268_284 Injuries have taken their toll
p268_285 Says the Duke of York
p268_286 How independent is that ?
p268_287 What form did that take ?
p268_288 Are they free ?
p268_289 What are they for ?
p268_290 Is there a waiting list ?
p268_291 When she went off it was quite amazing
p268_292 Our destiny is in our own hands
p268_293 The Royal Highland was no exception
p268_294 Downing Street insisted, We have made clear that the deadline is absolute
p268_295 She is currently the permanent secretary at the Department of Transport
p268_296 They need to be involved
p268_297 We've had great things in the past
p268_298 It could be done by experts and lawyers
p268_299 It has been recorded twice
p268_300 Aberdeen had little to offer
p268_301 It was only later that the condition was diagnosed
p268_302 This youngster is so exciting!
p268_303 I'm interested in interesting work
p268_304 They will probably come back
p268_305 Treasury spokesman Malcolm Bruce is also considered a potential contender
p268_306 It caused a lot of upset
p268_307 I saw them last week
p268_308 Friday night was a pretty good night
p268_309 This year, it will amount to a few hundred thousand pounds
p268_310 You were an easy target and therefore an easy sacrifice
p268_311 In general terms, the proposals are very much in line with expectations
p268_312 Everyone can have their opinion
p268_313 I was inspired by two things
p268_314 It was a lovely sunset
p268_315 Movie stars are public property
p268_316 It comes from reflection or thinking
p268_317 Life has changed for rugby players in just three years
p268_318 Indeed, he sees a shortage of skilled workers on the horizon
p268_319 The company hopes to repeat the process in France
p268_320 And we have the experience
p268_321 It gave me something to focus on
p268_322 The result is utterly compelling
p268_323 The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday
p268_324 It was his own decision
p268_325 You are a great player
p268_326 I won't make an official complaint
p268_327 British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US
p268_328 It particularly increases under-age drinking, he claimed
p268_329 It seemed a moving and fitting tribute
p268_330 Drink and petrol prices remain untouched
p268_331 We have an election in eight days
p268_332 Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match
p268_333 Thereafter they were allowed to proceed
p268_334 Walker plans to return indoors
p268_335 It is a triumphant performance, which defies the years
p268_336 The only problem was the greens
p268_337 HARRY Potter has lost his magic
p268_338 The business has expanded rapidly, however
p268_339 Dancing will help his ankles and his feet
p268_340 Twaddle is a case in point
p268_341 We used to live with dignity in our country
p268_342 Plans were made to expand
p268_343 My daughter is an adult
p268_344 Does it matter ?
p268_345 How do you take them away ?
p268_346 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p268_347 After the match, do you ?
p268_348 Have I really come to this ?
p268_349 Friends said he had suffered a blackout two weeks ago
p268_350 I am considered a teenager
p268_351 Anyway, the job will be part-time
p268_352 And the World Cup has not even begun
p268_353 Instead, he missed the lot
p268_354 Laura is an investment banker
p268_355 They had declined in each of the two preceding quarters
p268_356 The wedding date has been set for Orlando in Florida in October
p268_357 William Hague delighted his party
p268_358 We played them off the pitch
p268_359 Being captain of this club is fantastic
p268_360 I am not ready for Lennox Lewis
p268_361 McCall is unlikely to change a winning team
p268_362 The statement contained no surprises
p268_363 The performance continues to improve
p268_364 This would include the GM food industry
p268_365 There was an element of frustration
p268_366 We can't give any figures for Edinburgh
p268_367 Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh
p268_368 Weather should not be a factor
p268_369 It didn't matter who was in their way
p268_370 He ended up a headmaster
p268_371 He looked at me before replying
p268_372 I have little time for analysts
p268_373 I have huge respect for him as a journalist
p268_374 That remains the unanswered question
p268_375 He added, We are not prepared for war
p268_376 My wife and family are the support system
p268_377 David Murray, the Rangers chairman, also welcomed the scheme
p268_378 The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high
p268_379 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p268_380 Those overseas offices were great
p268_381 Another casualty yesterday was John Prescott
p268_382 Six games without defeat is the legacy so far
p268_383 Three weeks later, he resigned
p268_384 Labour will almost certainly remain in control
p268_385 Venus rejects the very suggestion
p268_386 We were beaten by the better team
p268_387 I have received no explanation
p268_388 Civic leaders yesterday praised the good behaviour of revellers across the country
p268_389 He also launched a new strategy for the agency
p268_390 And it had two seats
p268_391 This is a load of nonsense
p268_392 Potions said he would drive
p268_393 Calvin was always recognised as a player with potential
p268_394 Low pay is endemic in the National Health Service
p268_395 It is sending the wrong message to people
p268_396 Defensive stocks attracted some interest
p268_397 You can feel at home in China
p268_398 The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest
p268_399 It seems to have worked
p268_400 We have no information on Iraq
p268_401 Either way, the investor retains the premium
p268_402 There is no change in principle from the White Paper
p268_403 We're looking for unity in the council
p268_404 Reaction from Scottish business leaders was mixed
p268_405 The two clubs have agreed the transfer fee
p268_406 Washington is consumed by the crisis
p268_407 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p268_408 I should think so, too
p268_409 It makes no difference to their friendship
p268_410 It tells the story of a woman who has probably been abused
p268_411 The capital costs are modest
p269_001 Please call Stella
p269_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p269_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p269_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p269_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p269_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p269_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p269_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p269_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p269_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p269_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p269_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p269_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p269_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p269_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p269_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p269_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p269_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p269_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p269_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p269_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drop increases
p269_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of the number of bows
p269_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p269_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p269_025 She is given a new deputy minister for transport and planning
p269_026 But it failed
p269_027 He said the matter had been neglected in the past
p269_028 In both cases, I suffered a fiasco
p269_029 Several other countries are also reported to be interested in the format
p269_030 I have a theory
p269_031 Is this accurate?
p269_032 Because we do not need it
p269_033 He took me on a tour of the wards
p269_034 Mr Ferguson became a minister after seven years as a journalist
p269_035 Help is needed
p269_036 A web site is planned for November
p269_037 It can't just be a cynical marketing exercise
p269_038 Other members of the family were too upset to comment last night
p269_039 That's no bad thing
p269_040 Two other men, including the taxi driver, were wounded in the attack
p269_041 She is believed to be in South Africa
p269_042 I was scared
p269_043 It was ugly
p269_044 There will be no shortage of quality applicants
p269_045 Mexico City was a wonderful experience
p269_046 We're in the premier division and we intend to stay there
p269_047 Who can say?
p269_048 He had no enemies
p269_049 Her body was found about four miles from the car
p269_050 I was inspired by two things
p269_051 Several other pupils and staff were seriously injured in the accident
p269_052 It's very odd
p269_053 We have not given up hope
p269_054 This obsession wasn't just contained within the world of the losers
p269_055 New York is expected to come to a standstill
p269_056 We are a grandmother
p269_057 None has ever been found
p269_058 You do not change overnight
p269_059 Art is extra
p269_060 They're appalled by that
p269_061 There was a battle there
p269_062 Scotland had great assets
p269_063 It's that kind of place
p269_064 They are real
p269_065 I've spent a lot of time on buses
p269_066 Over time, with patience and precision, the terrorists will be pursued
p269_067 We have to be sure that the taxation system can work
p269_068 You need a trademark
p269_069 Painful, but only because it's true
p269_070 I was just trying to win the golf tournament
p269_071 It's a winner
p269_072 There could be a way back
p269_073 I was as strong as a horse
p269_074 Both sides have been hit by injury
p269_075 The girls are so lucky to be alive
p269_076 It is a job creation scheme
p269_077 There was no mention of an amnesty in the Belfast Agreement
p269_078 He is now resident in England
p269_079 Even the one she loved
p269_080 People must remain vigilant
p269_081 This is the way things should be handled
p269_082 It is not long term, but I need time to recover
p269_083 I'd like to continue that record
p269_084 That is bound to happen
p269_085 That's the principal difference between an artist and a dog
p269_086 All options are open
p269_087 Someone who cares
p269_088 By then, he was walking on water
p269_089 You will be
p269_090 He put some colour into Scottish history
p269_091 We see the rapid reaction force as the way ahead
p269_092 The name on the passport and other details have not been disclosed
p269_093 Today I couldn't run on it
p269_094 They've got to account for it
p269_096 Certainly, the Taliban regime is finished
p269_097 Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights
p269_098 An announcement on his replacement is expected within three weeks
p269_099 However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full
p269_100 May not have been at fault?
p269_101 We want to get to the final, anyway
p269_102 Oil embargo endorsed
p269_103 But they did not even get a reply to their letter
p269_104 No date has been set for the appeal
p269_105 It's not perfect
p269_106 While they went on holiday, we got the contract
p269_107 He pleaded for caution
p269_108 It was quite rigorous
p269_109 I was fighting for my life, I thought
p269_110 I can't even get into the A team
p269_111 The picture is the same across Scotland
p269_112 It was the eighties
p269_113 We have to look at everything before we make any final decision
p269_114 It's also important that they are not seen as a soft option
p269_115 Maybe this battle has been
p269_116 My office is bare
p269_117 Every woman deserves to live without this type of fear
p269_118 This is the first big idea of the Scottish Parliament election
p269_119 It was a delight on every level
p269_121 We recognise the important role of golf in attracting visitors
p269_122 She has been shot
p269_123 I thought it was a fantastic game
p269_124 Lady Thatcher was the only woman with full membership
p269_125 I could see his desire for the job in his eyes
p269_126 His son has been travelling with the Tartan Army for years
p269_127 Next season for every manager is a long time away
p269_128 It's the traumatic event in the childhood of the nation
p269_129 It's terrible that he has died the same way
p269_130 So the European elections are extremely important
p269_131 Offered the gold medal, he declined
p269_132 Who will attend?
p269_133 Twaddle is a case in point
p269_134 We had a reunion last week
p269_135 The trial is funded solely by Edinburgh City Council
p269_136 The whole thing of doing the movie was a risk
p269_137 It's the big omission
p269_138 If not, a deal could take many months
p269_139 What will happen then?
p269_140 Everyone is in favour of the need for welfare reform in general
p269_141 We are currently consulting with a wide range of interested parties
p269_142 It's a question of fashion
p269_143 He sees a difference in the style of the two teams
p269_144 It seems so long since I did the exams
p269_145 And the Farmer is worried about another aspect of farming life
p269_146 Wallace was a prisoner of war
p269_147 We will continue to talk to find a solution for Scottish football
p269_148 He is severe
p269_149 We just had a go
p269_150 She died at her home
p269_151 We have seen a copy of the report
p269_152 They did not replace it with a conviction for culpable homicide
p269_153 That could mean the difference between life and death in action
p269_154 It's like a football team
p269_155 It would be a last resort
p269_156 That group reported just before Christmas
p269_157 He will emerge as a world leader
p269_158 The Dutchman was in time to see the breakthrough
p269_159 I was so nervous
p269_160 We want to see the maximum of change
p269_161 Last night he was due to hold talks with Arafat
p269_162 His death was a tragic accident
p269_163 This latter point is hugely important
p269_164 It is so unfair
p269_165 It is an attitude of mind
p269_166 I've put my own money into this project
p269_167 They are expected to appear at Edinburgh Sheriff Court today
p269_168 I am now unemployed
p269_169 Military action is the only option we have on the table today
p269_170 We have to move forward
p269_171 We knew we had the goal we wanted
p269_172 I lost my head
p269_173 Customers for the panels include the National Trust for Scotland
p269_174 Mark Fisher was a guest of the Northern Ireland Tourist Board
p269_175 Waiting times for these services are too long
p269_176 They thought they had found a home
p269_177 His team management was protective
p269_179 But the petrol station does not get the benefit
p269_180 It was a great achievement to win at Wembley
p269_181 It is hard to avoid the conclusion that lessons have been learned
p269_182 I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal
p269_183 Everyone can be bought
p269_184 The conference is a chance for members to contribute to the debate
p269_185 They know no other way
p269_186 It's an idea
p269_187 They will run a mile
p269_188 Four policemen were wounded
p269_189 We did everything by the book
p269_190 Does this matter?
p269_191 My main concern is that public health is not put at risk
p269_193 It had been in place since last July
p269_194 I think the Commission has been very, very slow to react
p269_195 Neither side would reveal the details of the offer
p269_196 We must keep our feet on the ground
p269_197 Mr Kennedy is not a candidate for the Scottish Parliament
p269_198 The bottom line is that we had to get a win
p269_199 The conference is the first test
p269_200 We played them off the pitch
p269_201 He has a lot of experience as captain in his career
p269_202 On the outside of an airport, it is very difficult
p269_203 It was good fun
p269_204 The album was widely expected to be a commercial disaster
p269_205 It's all about money, money, money
p269_206 Some realism was needed about time, resources and management
p269_207 I had been at the Evening Standard for two years
p269_208 After that time, the market itself will set the prices
p269_209 But I am a worried man
p269_210 This gives a financial incentive to switch
p269_211 Saddam Hussein is a devil
p269_212 Feel the heat?
p269_213 HARRY Potter has lost his magic
p269_214 We have the experience, the courses, and an abundance of confidence
p269_215 I began to pray
p269_216 I am delighted for Simon
p269_217 It had all been arranged
p269_218 A Grampian Police spokesman said
p269_219 I have wanted to buy one for the National Gallery
p269_220 The attacker has been put in foster care
p269_221 For the refugees, the return will not come a moment too soon
p269_222 The council has proposed a temporary barrier to protect the monument
p269_223 The Prime Minister has a huge regard for Mo
p269_224 Who was on the panel?
p269_225 Naturally enough, the letter in question was an E
p269_226 It's so special
p269_227 The loss of a company to the industry is a blow
p269_228 Lottery cash is rightly dependent on grassroots approval
p269_229 I have spoken to the skipper
p269_230 I'd never seen a play about me
p269_231 It is perfectly evident that the time for an inquiry will come
p269_232 My neighbours are horrified
p269_233 But she was
p269_234 It's like a basketball
p269_235 And thought we would get away with it
p269_236 Of course, that is not the whole story
p269_237 Half of young people had had contact with the police
p269_238 Well, they were the unlucky ones
p269_239 The singer is expected to be in hospital for several days
p269_240 It's quite nice
p269_241 On the ground, the West Bank was again the focus of violence
p269_242 A succession of managers in the opera company resigned
p269_243 It would still have been a good film, but very different
p269_244 In fact, it is deeply unpleasant
p269_245 It is linked to the row over proposed changes at Scottish Ballet
p269_246 I know I'm in a very special position
p269_247 You can feel at home in China
p269_248 Some families have even requested to leave the city
p269_249 The project has already secured the support of Sir Sean Connery
p269_250 It's a record label, not a form of music
p269_251 I was shocked
p269_252 I should think so, too
p269_253 We decided we would go for a specialist inside centre
p269_254 Her presence was almost everywhere
p269_255 I can't get a job
p269_256 It is nearly there
p269_257 Special measures were needed
p269_258 For the Scottish judges, the affair is very delicate and unique
p269_259 The distinction is also supported by doctors
p269_260 It is fantastic that other women will be able to benefit
p269_261 Kirkwood was arrested
p269_263 I am very angry
p269_264 It is also very valuable
p269_265 This court has made an order which has not been observed
p269_266 The work between the musicians and the fire is very important
p269_267 The warning is timely
p269_268 Labour's Scottish general secretary Alex Rowley was delighted yesterday
p269_269 They want to shut the Scottish Office
p269_270 They are never here
p269_271 The government has until midnight tomorrow to make a decision
p269_272 On this showing, they should stick with the lads
p269_273 It left me with a sadness
p269_274 Similar measures are expected in England and Wales
p269_275 We do not want any terrorist attacks on any Israeli civilians
p269_276 But, in fact, the reverse is true
p269_277 They wanted the club to make money
p269_278 It's a way of life
p269_279 The decision was announced at its annual conference in Dunfermline
p269_280 A search and rescue mission was mounted within minutes
p269_281 He promised to lead from the front in the battle for entry
p269_282 However, he will have his work cut out defending his title
p269_283 In essence, the teaching profession has a choice
p269_284 In fact, he was talking about the survival business
p269_285 It happens from time to time
p269_286 If not, he should go home
p269_287 They were too hard
p269_288 I saw it at a ruck
p269_289 I intended to look for another club on loan
p269_290 You've got to have both sides
p269_291 What would be the timetable for withdrawal?
p269_292 It was a virus
p269_293 Who will perform?
p269_294 It's like a high school play
p269_295 This is a national crisis
p269_296 I feel really sorry for the Iraqi people
p269_297 The amount of energy in a tornado is enormous
p269_298 Police were called to the ground and interviewed a number of people
p269_299 It shows a contempt by him for the industry
p269_300 It changed my life
p269_301 It's an issue that will have to be tackled
p269_302 Sunday's game was not a trial
p269_303 If you can run a computer, you can talk to the world
p269_304 A new school will be built
p269_305 I have tonight resigned as a member of the European Commission
p269_306 Right up until a week ago we thought they were very keen
p269_307 I was the sheep
p269_308 Graeme was prepared
p269_309 However, the snow was welcomed by some
p269_310 But it's a subtle process
p269_311 The award to Senator Mitchell was announced by the Foreign Office
p269_312 There is no openness
p269_313 They are wrong
p269_314 Details of the new vessel were given in London yesterday
p269_315 Violence and threatening behaviour has no place in a school
p269_316 In performance, that quality can prove to be a challenge
p269_317 It's just not funny!
p269_318 It is no country for a man or woman of letters
p269_319 They would now be able to look forward with confidence
p269_320 The report will go before the Scottish Parliament, probably in early autumn
p269_321 SCOTLAND has shown the way
p269_322 I did not name it
p269_323 The Government in Westminster is simply not prepared to save him
p269_324 We have got no money to go anywhere
p269_325 This wasn't the way it was supposed to be
p269_326 It's about my time as a guitarist
p269_327 I was rubbish
p269_328 We are a peaceful people
p269_329 The election is total confusion and chaos
p269_330 Kids are terrible
p269_331 Henman has been warned
p269_332 Ms Anderson yesterday put a brave face on the departure
p269_333 The problems began a long time ago
p269_334 Referees are easy targets
p269_335 They had a confession
p269_336 In the old days, it was easy
p269_337 However, the groups denied the claims
p269_338 I came into this world with nothing
p269_339 That's the law of the land
p269_340 There was no time scale
p269_341 It is a strong case
p269_342 Is there a new way forward?
p269_343 They also recovered a picture of Osama bin Laden
p269_344 The boat was fantastic
p269_345 I'd like to take the plunge
p269_346 Later in the day he was forced to explain his position
p269_347 You can see it on the training ground and around the hotel
p269_348 It's been hard
p269_349 Her husband was very concerned that it might be fatal
p269_350 It is a sign of hope
p269_352 It has moved on in the last week
p269_353 That's not eviction because he is not a tenant
p269_354 You feel the pride
p269_355 The train was on time
p269_356 It was so new, so exciting
p269_357 Sex offender programmes to be retained by public sector
p269_358 A great deal has been achieved
p269_359 It was forced to divert
p269_360 It should be scrapped
p269_361 It is long gone
p269_362 I HAVE a dream
p269_363 Tyson is overwhelmed
p269_364 As, indeed, they would be
p269_365 But the real problem is the closure of the export market
p269_366 It is the Holiday programme with a mortgage
p269_367 Instead, he was informed to join the line of creditors
p269_368 We will be homeless
p269_369 I expected these kind of questions
p269_370 Six of the asylum seekers left the offices, it was reported
p269_371 It should be an enjoyable and challenging period of their lives
p269_372 It's a true story
p269_373 All the investment is possible through the public sector
p269_374 He later became a respected High Court judge
p269_375 The play is based on a real-life event
p269_376 He could face a jail sentence
p269_377 The final decision was between Scotland and the Republic of Ireland
p269_378 They have not done so this season so far
p269_379 I decided to tell a bit of the story about myself
p269_380 They play together perfectly
p269_381 It is a large number
p269_382 He could not be contacted for further comment yesterday
p269_383 They haven't got a hope
p269_384 It is obvious that we are engaged in a war
p269_385 He denied the charge
p269_386 You can cope with it
p269_387 I am very happy with life
p269_388 A young Briton had a lucky escape
p269_389 Treatment is not an issue with these people
p269_391 If you look at the other galleries in this area
p269_392 In Scotland, we keep the faith
p269_393 On the contrary, it was actually very funny
p269_394 I'm pleased about one thing
p269_395 It is unusual
p269_396 We have to pull together, or we will hang apart
p269_397 I suspect the latter
p269_398 Apart from the result we have to be happy with our performance
p269_399 Well, it did last time, he was reminded
p269_400 By then, a massive legal battle is likely to have started
p269_401 My husband was born in Zimbabwe
p269_402 The car was just there
p269_403 The jury is expected to return a verdict in the case today
p270_001 Please call Stella
p270_002 Ask her to bring these things with her from the store
p270_003 Six spoons of fresh snow peas, five thick slabs of blue cheese, and maybe a snack for her brother Bob
p270_004 We also need a small plastic snake and a big toy frog for the kids
p270_005 She can scoop these things into three red bags, and we will go meet her Wednesday at the train station
p270_006 When the sunlight strikes raindrops in the air, they act as a prism and form a rainbow
p270_007 The rainbow is a division of white light into many beautiful colors
p270_008 These take the shape of a long round arch, with its path high above, and its two ends apparently beyond the horizon
p270_009 There is , according to legend, a boiling pot of gold at one end
p270_010 People look, but no one ever finds it
p270_011 When a man looks for something beyond his reach, his friends say he is looking for the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow
p270_012 Throughout the centuries people have explained the rainbow in various ways
p270_013 Some have accepted it as a miracle without physical explanation
p270_014 To the Hebrews it was a token that there would be no more universal floods
p270_015 The Greeks used to imagine that it was a sign from the gods to foretell war or heavy rain
p270_016 The Norsemen considered the rainbow as a bridge over which the gods passed from earth to their home in the sky
p270_017 Others have tried to explain the phenomenon physically
p270_018 Aristotle thought that the rainbow was caused by reflection of the sun's rays by the rain
p270_019 Since then physicists have found that it is not reflection, but refraction by the raindrops which causes the rainbows
p270_020 Many complicated ideas about the rainbow have been formed
p270_021 The difference in the rainbow depends considerably upon the size of the drops, and the width of the colored band increases as the size of the drops increases
p270_022 The actual primary rainbow observed is said to be the effect of super-imposition of a number of bows
p270_023 If the red of the second bow falls upon the green of the first, the result is to give a bow with an abnormally wide yellow band, since red and green light when mixed form yellow
p270_024 This is a very common type of bow, one showing mainly red and yellow, with little or no green or blue
p270_025 He was afraid to stay in hospital in Kosovo
p270_026 They will not be allowed to succeed
p270_027 Smoking is also very important
p270_028 Allan Johnston was not match fit
p270_029 It was as if I had been stabbed
p270_030 He has the courage of the unaware
p270_031 Drugs are a serious problem
p270_032 We have to find a way to put that right
p270_033 That is the face of fear
p270_034 Of course, on Tuesday, United were beaten despite this
p270_035 Costs have got to be controlled
p270_036 He really is a lovely man
p270_037 There will be no shortage of quality applicants
p270_038 The staff are as good as any staff in the city
p270_039 This represents a tough game for us
p270_040 The boy is no longer with us
p270_041 Among them are many criminals
p270_042 Merger would be entirely logical
p270_043 Must be prepared to use it
p270_044 Not if you know the person
p270_045 That was the theory, anyway
p270_046 I had come back from London
p270_047 I had trouble with the producers
p270_048 Maybe full-time referees will provide the answer
p270_049 My fitness was very poor
p270_050 He also presented You Bet!
p270_051 What do they want us to do ?
p270_052 Is it worth it ?
p270_053 Does it matter ?
p270_054 How do you take them away ?
p270_055 However, there is an issue, isn't there ?
p270_056 After the match, do you ?
p270_057 Because we do not need it
p270_058 The outcome of their game isn't the important thing
p270_059 The City welcomed the brighter outlook
p270_060 We have not given up hope
p270_061 In time, the First Minister will grow in stature
p270_062 We have made a commitment to those people
p270_063 Have a look at our accounts
p270_064 Charles Kennedy had an effective outing
p270_065 Final proposals will be published in February
p270_066 Robin Williams is very subdued
p270_067 It wasn't possible to relax
p270_068 Then followed a bout of flu
p270_069 Both sides have been hit by injury
p270_070 Last night, the move was bitterly denounced by France Telecom
p270_071 Halifax has also been mentioned as a likely predator
p270_072 The guidelines are expected to be finalised before next spring
p270_073 She declined to give the reasons for the decision
p270_074 It is not in my nature
p270_075 My immune system had been depleted
p270_076 It was a unanimous decision
p270_077 It makes for an interesting conference
p270_078 I've had it for the exams
p270_079 I first met him last summer
p270_080 The tickets will be on sale today at the ticket office
p270_081 They lived for their children
p270_082 Potions said he would drive
p270_083 The city council is a major property owner in the area
p270_084 Last weekend was extremely frustrating
p270_085 Western countries condemned the conduct of the poll
p270_086 The commission initiated the necessary changes in the financial regulation
p270_087 The outsourcing deal will take effect in September
p270_088 The peace process will be buried!
p270_089 They must be on commission
p270_090 He is an extraordinary writer on so many levels
p270_091 Previously, they were raised in the European Court of Human Rights
p270_092 We haven't finished the complaints procedure
p270_093 The move follows a review of the Singapore
p270_094 However, the intensive care unit at the Southern General Hospital was full
p270_095 We should recognise that others have done a good job
p270_096 It was some time before she found out he was safe
p270_097 But the battle has only just begun
p270_098 In the end we made too many errors
p270_099 That time is not now, however
p270_100 The following are the principal provisions
p270_101 But his speech was delivered by a senior civil servant
p270_102 The new system will be marketed this summer
p270_103 We needed financial backing to get it off the ground
p270_104 I'm delighted for everyone at Stirling
p270_105 I understand the medical concerns
p270_106 The arrangement will avoid any conflicts of interest
p270_107 Scotland will be an integral part of Abbey National
p270_108 We deserve a significant rise
p270_109 I would be prepared to go anywhere
p270_110 You had better believe it
p270_111 The website has changed the company
p270_112 This is a step backwards
p270_113 IT HAS been the year of the youngster at Kilmarnock
p270_114 The situation is not easy, but we will prevail
p270_115 Its replacement was not used in the exercise
p270_116 The problem was a social problem
p270_117 Figures are not relevant to the strategy
p270_118 You were made to feel so welcome
p270_119 You must always attempt to raise the bar
p270_120 You can spend money on housing
p270_121 It's not a quick fix
p270_122 That admission is not surprising
p270_123 Those people must be accountable
p270_124 I've never seen a game like it
p270_125 They keep the atmosphere in mind
p270_126 But we could only help a handful of people
p270_127 Sentencing is due to take place tomorrow morning
p270_128 Becoming a father was wonderful
p270_129 I was on a roll
p270_130 Are they free ?
p270_131 What are they for ?
p270_132 Is there a waiting list ?
p270_133 Do they think anyone else wants them ?
p270_134 So what happens next ?
p270_135 The abuse of elderly people was appalling
p270_136 But beyond a fairly minimal level it has little impact
p270_137 The first half was depressing
p270_138 They made such decisions in London
p270_139 Italy was just behind the US
p270_140 The judges will give a ruling next Wednesday
p270_141 I feel very grateful with everything
p270_142 There was an element of frustration
p270_143 Before it was an ordeal
p270_144 I have a kind of love affair with Hollywood
p270_145 Five minutes later, the home team were back in front
p270_146 Their prescription is largely about changing attitudes
p270_147 Drugs are used a lot at the fishing, not just cannabis
p270_148 No-one from the Fire Brigades Union was available for comment yesterday
p270_149 We will provide immediate access
p270_150 I am delighted for everyone in Airdrie
p270_151 It is not disputed that the driver was at fault
p270_152 The departure of Mr Johnston was reported by The Herald yesterday
p270_153 They have not been named
p270_154 The transaction is not feasible
p270_155 It is ambitious, but it can be achieved
p270_156 We will turn the corner
p270_157 My Dad is a hero
p270_158 Do you think we are a top nation ?
p270_159 Is our children learning ?
p270_160 How independent is that ?
p270_161 What form did that take ?
p270_162 They've also enjoyed their share of good fortune
p270_163 There remains an outstanding damages action against the former
p270_164 The woman was his wife
p270_165 This action reflects a slump in bookings
p270_166 Scotland came very close in the second Test
p270_167 We did what we had to do
p270_168 The strong performance is expected to continue
p270_169 She returned to the theatre
p270_170 It's nice to be involved
p270_171 That would open the gates of hell
p270_172 Next year it plans to open an office in Tokyo
p270_173 Nobody did in those days
p270_174 There is no signature on this document
p270_175 I would be very keen on a move to Italy
p270_176 They could not match it
p270_177 His team management was protective
p270_178 The jury is still out
p270_179 The outcome is now in our own hands
p270_180 City sentiment is in his favour
p270_181 I've been in two finals, and I've got a medal
p270_182 I'm pretty happy with the way I played
p270_183 Playing in Europe is the benchmark
p270_184 For example, I supported the government on Afghanistan and Kosovo
p270_185 It appears that it was just a genuine mistake
p270_186 They are determined to make a meaningful contribution
p270_187 They receive a high profile in the media
p270_188 That's not fair to the supporters
p270_189 They bought the property four years ago
p270_190 They need to look after themselves
p270_191 Miller was every bit as happy
p270_192 You know the sort of thing
p270_193 They were seriously after him
p270_194 Any change would be subject to the Scottish Parliament's approval
p270_195 We represent a wide range of society
p270_196 Motorists will buy passes in advance
p270_197 It's very difficult to find a buyer
p270_198 I know every village and island on the west coast
p270_199 Mr Blair was ready for him
p270_200 He should emerge as the winner
p270_201 In France, the reverse is true
p270_202 I came home by ambulance
p270_203 It comes from reflection or thinking
p270_204 They have the cash and the fire power
p270_205 We believe a third party was involved
p270_206 The early physical reports were clear
p270_207 The sisters also became the top two players in the world
p270_208 Stephen has never considered the question of compensation
p270_209 The Shadow Chancellor is away on holiday
p270_210 This decision will prove to be the opposite of a standstill
p270_211 I am very realistic about these things
p270_212 British Midland has applied for permission to fly to the US
p270_213 They are looking at a flotation
p270_214 There can be no compromise on that demand
p270_215 Flanker Gordon Simpson may also feature in that match
p270_216 It would appear to be a good time to invest
p270_217 HARRY Potter has lost his magic
p270_218 From there, they can go anywhere
p270_219 There is no excuse for domestic abuse
p270_220 It had all been arranged
p270_221 What was the matter for concern ?
p270_222 Do I think about them often ?
p270_223 Is it in the right place ?
p270_224 Did he trip ?
p270_225 Does that put pressure on us ?
p270_226 It was finally agreed on Saturday
p270_227 Basically, they have to come up with the offer
p270_228 They are difficult awards to decide
p270_229 I am considered a teenager
p270_230 There's a chance they might come down
p270_231 Yet the evidence is plain to see
p270_232 There was the option of following the Celtic to Portugal
p270_233 I wouldn't even respond to that question
p270_234 People should make their own decisions
p270_235 Investors were also concerned about margin pressure
p270_236 They all made the European Ryder Cup team
p270_237 That was a real challenge
p270_238 His background is firmly in venture capital
p270_239 The plan was yesterday endorsed by employers and unions
p270_240 We were a shambles at the back
p270_241 The scientific debate is dead
p270_242 They are the innocent victims
p270_243 You should always be able to get out in some direction
p270_244 Corporate banking would be based in Edinburgh
p270_245 This would include the GM food industry
p270_246 And he goes with it
p270_247 It had so much to do with output
p270_248 Many farmers cannot even agree within their own families
p270_249 That will be a decision for BBC Scotland
p270_250 The irony was not lost
p270_251 I might get an injury very easily
p270_252 It might be sad, but it's a fact
p270_253 Everything depends on the weather
p270_254 This is a historic occasion
p270_255 This championship is different from the other majors
p270_256 Labour was too busy to respond
p270_257 I was just getting over the time difference
p270_258 I'm not making any specific attempt on the world record
p270_259 Either way, the investor retains the premium
p270_260 There is no change in principle from the White Paper
p270_261 You're not getting any goodwill
p270_262 Now, suddenly, we have this new landscape
p270_263 No production contract is yet in sight
p270_264 Tourism is a vital industry for Scotland
p270_265 A thousand years ago the church was a powerful force in Europe
p270_266 We accept the new rules
p270_267 It is probably in the culture
p270_268 He took over our lives
p270_269 I'd never run for them
p270_270 how do you get it back ?
p270_271 What are you not good at ?
p270_272 I think, therefore I am ?
p270_273 Who was she ?
p270_274 Or was it ?
p270_275 And they were being paid ?
p270_276 These figures are truly terrible
p270_277 The amount of alcohol as a whole was very high
p270_278 He could see no other bidder
p270_279 There's not much money in cycling
p270_280 None of this work is guaranteed
p270_281 This could put pressure on UK inflation
p270_282 Any error is severely punished
p270_283 Brown is an interesting man, but he is not desperate
p270_284 I understand the security issue
p270_285 It left me with a sadness
p270_286 Similar measures are expected in England and Wales
p270_287 The target is to break even by Christmas
p270_288 It was never a free kick
p270_289 The manager's position was obviously included in that review
p270_290 It involved the same people
p270_291 She has fallen in love with Scotland, however
p270_292 You have to expect this type of thing
p270_293 There's always the next century
p270_294 It's hard to see it
p270_295 The partnership was set up during the summer
